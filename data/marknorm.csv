"If Karen was a video game, the boss would be Ellen."
You never hear about regular terrestrials.
It’s gonna be really weird when full nude strip clubs open & the stripper is completely naked except for a mask.
In the past it was weird to not be a flat earther.
Hot ep!!!
I just realized how eerie it is that Corona beer ads have always been just an empty beach or one couple on an island alone. It’s like they knew.
"I bring White Claws everywhere I go, that’s what I call my toenails."
"This virus is like a horror movie plot,  you catch it if you have fun."
All the employees got sick: Staff Infection.
Karen is the female version of ‘Adolph.’
Comedy!!
Every Friday now feels like Christmas but we’re all Jewish.
Corona feels homophobic at this point. It’s preventing us from being open and coming out.
"Thanks Dave, you're my hero!! Only 40k to go!! Comedy!"
"We might have to cancel Santa. Going inside every house on Earth, in one night with no mask. ‘Covid’ even sounds like one of his reindeeer? He’s gonna spread Christmas cheer & corona."
Same
"You’ve heard of tennis elbow, next will be ‘Zoom shoulder.’"
Ironically the cancel button when you’re typing a tweet could save you from experiencing that very thing.
"Someone told me 9/11 jokes can’t be funny, I agree, 2 towers fell. Everyone knows good jokes follow the rule of threes."
This is the first time in history someone might assassinate the president with a well timed sneeze.
Feels kinda shady using Safari to download Chrome. It’s like using your wife to get to her hotter sister.
Just tell trump the mask is like a wall for your face to prevent alien objects from getting in.
"Your ancestors also wore powdered wigs, you can throw on a mask."
"Michael Jackson would've never made it thru this pandemic, he only had one glove."

"Poor Biden, if he’s wearing a mask how’s he gonna smell little girl’s hair?"
"This is like the opposite of the Wild West, all the people carrying guns aren’t wearing masks."
Castaway or me last night trying to pleasure my lady?
Some people say “that’s what she said!!!” ironically but I can tell they’re really proud of it.
“These viruses are taking our jobs!!!”
I’ll never remember this word
My parents weren’t trying.
I hope they don’t breastfeed.

This shut down feels like an acid trip. At first it’s kinda strange & fun but it’s lasting so long I’m getting scared it’ll never end!!
Wooo baby! The special is on a roll folks & I can’t thank you all enough for spreading the butter. Tonight will make a week & we’re almost at a mill. One more big push fatties & lets see if we can push this baby out.  . Thanks & Praise Allah!
Korea is the mullet of countries: No fun up top and party on the bottom.
You never hear about the guy murdered in warm blood.
We complain about America a lot but when you see the ghouls people are willing to bang on 90 Day Fiancé just to get into the U.S. it makes you realize what you’ve got.

“Comedian Mark Normand irresponsibly broke the rules of quarantine and rented a large venue & put on a secret standup comedy show for his fans. Luckily, for the health of others, no one showed.”"
"When the news discusses health effects on the black community they’ll have an African American on.  But when talking about obesity, they never bring on a porker."
Any gal I know that refers to herself as ‘queen’ always has the least responsibilities.
Fraternity ward
"My crazy uncle treats covid like it’s the tooth fairy, he thinks it’s all made up but he still wants the free money."
Good advice for animals at the vet.
You never hear about the guy who takes himself way too comedically.
All heterosexual dogs go to heaven.

"PSA from Flint, MI."
"We really wanna get rid of covid, let’s get a picture of it going up a turtle’s nose."
"I see people complaining a lot again, that’s a good sign, we might be coming out of this!"
"To an adult the word ‘Mister’ is a sign of respect but if you say it to kid, he’s in trouble."
Not literally.
"WiFi: You have very little connection. 

Me: You have no idea."
I’ve gained weight and I’m in captivity. I’m starting to relate to the orcas at Seaworld with the collapse dorsal fin.
"I haven’t come up with any ideas in weeks, probably because I come up with my ideas in the shower."

"A fun clip for my new special “Out To Lunch.” Give it a whirl, a share & a queef! Tell an asian!"
Because of this virus everyone needs a mask and some need a muzzle.
You never hear about someone living their worst life.
"This virus feels like planking, it took the world by storm, I don’t want my friends to succumb to it & I can’t wait till it goes away."
I have a feeling the gals from ‘2 Girls 1 Cup’ have built up an immunity.

"Once life’s normal again, we’re gonna look back on this like high school, “Why was I so miserable during that time? I had no responsibilities and all I did was hang out & drink!”"
An OFF type spray but to repel incest.
Unstable Fathers Clash : UFC
At that point maybe just leave her alone.
"Mattress Salesman: “You sure this is size you want ma’am?”

Annoying Lady: “Yaaas, Queen!!!!!”"
"Too much beer gives you a beer belly, too many stoned munchies have given me a pot belly."
At least in Castaway he had the beach.
Sounds like a pyramid scheme.
Coronavirus seems like the only thing in the White House with a clear plan.
“Am I muted?” is the new “is this thing on?”
"Not sure which belief I struggle with more, god or Cbd."
It’s fun seeing every guy's mom picture because you can see why they like their current girlfriend.
"- What kinda cheese you want?

- American!!"

Still can’t believe this all started from a guy having sex with a bat.
"- Knock, knock

"Horrible name for a new water park: 
“Wet Market”"
"This shutdown proves that I don’t use coffee for work, it’s just an addiction."
Tonight kicks off the official Coast to Coast Roast!! Cities from all across the nation battle it out for the title. I’m hosting with my main squeeze @JoeListComedy! It’s gonna be a doozy!
"With my friends shaved heads, beards & basement apts, their Zoom videos look like hostage footage. “uh we’re doing ok, staying safe but they say if we leave we’ll die.”"
"""Out to Lunch"" on 5/12 folks. Comedy!"
It’s funny how when this is all over were gonna act like we accomplished something.
"As a performer these days I’m climbing the walls, I can’t imagine how mass shooters must feel."

Cinco
This year Cinco de Mayo is less about the celebration and more just reminding us of the date.
"- “I’ll call you tomorrow.”

- “Sounds good.” *in my head* Great, now my whole Wednesday is slammed!"
"A priest, a minister and a rabbi walk into a liquor store; “thank god you’re open!” Clerk says “No, thank me.”"
"Should be Charlie Sheen, he’s crazy and knows about tiger blood."
You know you’re on too much when you scroll to the bottom of twitter.
"- Imagine quarantine without the arts. 

- I don’t know if I’d call 90 Day Fiancé ‘the arts.’"
"This pandemic has made me realize if I was a robber, I’d get to the store and realize I forgot my mask."
"Coronavirus is like having a crazy stalker. I’m nervous going outside, if I do I cover my face and my family thinks it’s all made up."
This is the only time you can tell someone’s political affiliation by how much fun they’re having outside.
People going on strike so they can start working makes my brain hurt.
Midlife Isis
Not wearing protection is called 'raw dog' but that also sounds like what'll give us the next virus.
"Grocery:

You can’t bring any bags into the store but a gross mask you’ve been breathing in for weeks is mandatory."
"With all the attention hospital staffs are getting, hopefully all those people who dreamt of being in showbiz will just become nurses."
Everyone gets their 10 minutes of flame.
"- What are you watching these days?

- My life pass me by."
"You know that friend who says he’s gonna write a screen play or start a business but you know he never will, that’s me now with showering."

I’ll refer to this time in our life as “Zoom and gloom.”
Those were the days!
It’s gonna be weird seeing people face to face again and not be able to mute them.
I wanna see a video where professional dancers break out into nursing.
"During the pandemic, street traffic is way down but men sitting alone in their car is through the roof."
"I'm down to eating one meal a day, it lasts about 8 hours."
"I’m not very outdoorsy. Nature is like a hot guy to me, I can appreciate the beauty but I don’t wanna be in it."
Sex Lube = Crude Oil
This is that 5th dentist

"- Opinions are like assholes, every body’s got one. 

- But if you don’t have one then you’re completely full of shit."
One uplifting quote you don’t want hanging on a hospital wall: “Stay Positive.”
Great message for horny single guys.
An unboxing video of an antibody test.

"‘Covid-19’ sounds like the ultimate modern pop star: genderless, constantly trending, and big in the  black community."
Everyone’s about to get more likable
“Can you hear me?” Is the new ‘hello.’
Kim Jong puts the ‘Un’ in fUNeral.

"Ironically, my mullet shows I’ve been following the rules."
Trump: “I’m not saying Clorox will cure you but it might Tide you over.”
"Right now, the most responsible way to kill someone is a drive by."
"Me: I’m so bored!! 

Acquaintance: Wanna video chat?

"If you’re gonna post racist anti Chinese things online, don’t do it from an iPhone, have some respect for the kid who made it."
It’s sad how high the infection rate is in the black community. I assume it’s because of institutionalized racism and elaborate handshakes.
The original minority.
"I went to a Zoom funeral yesterday, it was really sad but literally the only upside is no one knew I was hard."
"In the near future, soulmates won’t say “I love you,” a guy will get down on one knee and say “I agree with you on everything.”"
"Quarantining in small apartment. 

Me: *walks into other room*

Girlfriend: Where you going?"
Joe Biden needs auto correct but for talking.
"After this is all over, the first thing I’m gonna do is get a haircut in a restaurant."

I’m so lonely that I’m starting to understand the guy who rubs one out on the subway.
"“You can’t even see it, it’s not real and yet you guys let it rule your lives!” Conservatives feel about Coronavirus the way I feel about religion."

I live in a small apt and photos of your backyard get me excited. Please send me a deck pic!
"People who applaud the nurses from home, we get it, you have a balcony."
Posting photos of your backyard is insensitive to people who live in apartments.
"People keep comparing this to September 11th, both horrible but at least during 9/11 I wasn’t constantly doing dishes."
Me eating most of the take out before I get home.
Pretty soon there will be a slur for people who don’t distance & form crowds. I’m thinking “Groupers.”

Can’t wait for the corona summer blockbuster about the nurse who falls for an infected patient. “You Touched Your Face then my Heart.”
Thank god he didn’t check it.

Confidence is delusion. Never forget you suck and don’t let anyone tell you any different.
"- I can’t picture my life without my kids. 

- Then you have a really weak imagination."
Sometimes I feel insecure then I realize I’ve never seen Joseph A. Banks not having a sale.
That kid was actually three
My priest won’t text me back. I guess I got holy ghosted.
Remember to keep a polite distance when someone’s making a deposit at the sperm bank.
Weird that everyone in Star Wars has a laser gun or a lightsaber but no one uses a smart phone.
"""Blood, sweat and tears"" is a fun band or a description of the night I lost my virginity."
"Horny & hungry are similar, both need to be satisfied. Although, when you're hungry you can't just think back to great meals you've had."

What’s that yoga pose where you clench your hands & butt while someone says hi to everyone and you’re worried he’s gonna skip you?
"I’m glad Mr. Peanut is dead. He was an evil dictator, roasting then selling his own kind for decades."
"I bought both, I call them John Wick and Candle Jenner."

USA!!!
A Shazam app but for the names of people you’ve met once.
"When you’re a kid you cleaned your room because you were in trouble, as an adult you clean your room because you’re on an amphetamine."
If an adult woman calls a young boy ‘mister’ he’s about to get yelled at like an adult.

Me: Spoiler alert!!"
Snow globes are gonna be great souvenirs to help us remember when we had snow.

"Dry rub, great for a chicken finger, horrible for fingering."

Ramen has a great PR team. It went from broke 10 cent college meal to trendy $13 lunch spot.
‘House’ & ‘home’ mean basically the same thing but they aren’t really interchangeable. You wouldn’t have a Funeral House or a Waffle Home.
"Whenever people complain about over population, they never do their part."
The state flag of Florida should be two geckos fighting over a coke filled condom in the parking lot of a gun range.
A beard is not an accomplishment.

If you're black and someone calls you 'the man' you're a cool guy. If you're white & you’re called 'the man' you've ruined something fun.

How tall do you have to be to ride an emotional roller coaster?
I’m extremely well read if we’re counting reading into things.
"Wife: It’s against the law, sorey."
“Shady” is a good term for someone who’s suspicious or heavy set.
I don't trust an elevator button that doesn't light up.

"Apparently, only having to lug around one nut makes you wildly productive."
"Child, domestic, animal - out of all the abuses, substance is the coolest because you’re mostly hurting just you."
"No matter what you tell a woman about a certain guy’s penis size, every time they’ll say “I knew it.”"
"You never hear about other ranks of obvious, only captain."
"When it comes to ‘Memory’ for some reason you never stroll down a boulevard, street or avenue."
Weird way to say you’re rubbing one out.
"Not hooking up with family members, that’s called ‘Outcest.’"
"Wow, he dodged a lot of straws."
"The good news is, if Harvey goes to jail he can shower in front of as many people as he wants!"
"My friend is hoping to have a gay son. It’s tough because you don’t know for about 4 years after. It’s not like it comes out & says “Woo, I’ll never touch one of those again!”"
I saw an ad that said ‘exercise is the best drug.’ Then it’s definitely the only drug where the withdrawals are happiness.
A little person.
"Friend: Why don’t you buy yourself some new clothes? 

Me: Why? I’ve stopped growing."
This is fun!
Your phone is the only addiction that you can actually use to get help.
"If you can’t be around peanuts, be careful when you eat ass."
"I wanna write a book about what an evil group heterosexuals are called “I, Cis.”"
What’s the origin of the word ‘Etymology?’
How many times can I look in the fridge before I realize I am at the wrong apartment?
"If you fly a lot it starts so fun then becomes a stale relationship. The beginning it’s exciting, trips, dinner & a movie. But eventually you’re in pajamas, earbuds in yelling “I’m trying to sleep!”"
"Friend: I’ll have the grass fed Kobe beef, no rice.

Me: Wow, so healthy.

Friend: Gotta do it. You are what you eat. 

Waitress: No, cows are vegetarians."

"If we’re counting internet comments, I’m extremely well read."
Why can’t I find a straight conversion camp?
How come no one takes random positive things personally?
You're the reason I get out of bed in the afternoon.

"When a grammar nazi asks to see your papers, it’s for a different reason."
"I’m jealous of trans people’s strength. I don’t have the self esteem to correct people who get my name wrong, let alone my gender."
"If you’re attracted to cops, don’t order a police escort. It’s not what you think."
"Veggie burgers, cashew butter, oat milk - I’m glad food worries less about appropriation than we do."
The homeless?
My body needs a woman’s touch.

Dad: Get out."
“My phone is dead” is the new ‘I forgot my wallet.’
McRibbed.
"Going to someone’s house just to hook up is that same awkward feeling when you sit down at a buffet and both think ""how long do we wait before we start?"""
Rip city!!!!!!!!!
One nice thing about the holidays is you can take a break from disliking yourself and let your parents take over for a little while.
"The day after Thanksgiving feels like a crazy hook up. Drank a ton, went at it hard, woke up & went for it again in the morning, now I hate myself."
"Turkey is the closest I’ll come to doing heroin. I crave it, heat it up, pierce the skin, pass out and wake up sad & alone."
Thanksgiving is a good day to blend in if you’re narcoleptic.
Every thanksgiving I do intermittent fasting for 20 minutes between seconds.

As more movie theaters close the theaters are getting way nicer. That’s like a 90 yr old guy getting plugs & a tan. “All this at the end?”
Really depends on the person.
I’ve got the perfect solution for all thanksgiving family tensions & arguments: CBD infused turkey.
"Technically, we’re all pre-med."
You never hear about the ‘grammar Jews.’
"Credit cards are like cats. One or two is ok but if you have more than 8, you’re trying to fill a hole."
When I look at baby yoda I only think 2 things: he’s super cute & there’s no way he’d let you abort him.
"Good point, pour another one."
Comedy!
"Dicks are like bouncers, when you don’t know one it’s scary but if you’re cool with it you want it to be huge and ready to throw down."
Anything scooped with an ice cream scooper that's not ice cream is so much sadder.
Man boobs are cigarettes & lady boobs are marijuana. Most people hate man boobs yet they’re allowed everywhere - lady boobs are fun & not harmful yet still mostly criminalized.

'Butt' and 'booty' mean basically the same thing but there's a big difference when it comes to calls.

What's so bad about tooting your own horn? It's your horn.
"First books then movies, now tv. I wonder if in 100 years people will brag about still making time to watch tv? “He’s so smart, he’s very well watched.”"
"Thank god women don’t get blue balls, we’d all be dead. #comedy"

How is the Bible not cancelled?
You never hear about an upward spiral.
I’m a real margarine face.
"“I’m with child.”

Gotta be tough on ladies to have the bra cup sizes just out there. If men had to tell ppl they were packing a ‘full B’ they’d get implants too.
"- I don’t want these trans people in my bathroom!

- Cosby."
"My friend said ‘moist’ is the most horrific word in the English language. I don’t know, I think the N word is still worse."

"Ladies, if your man can’t dance get ready to be spun a LOT."
We all know what happens when you drop the soap in a prison shower. Don't you think it's about time we get these guys some body wash?
"It's true, my ex used to wake me up, now I'm gay."
"Red cars are pulled over more so that settles it, police do pull people over based on color."

How is it that I love being alone yet I’m still scared of having no one?
"Friend: I’m jealous of people who believe in god, that must be nice. 

Me: I feel the same way but about my self."

Has ‘Intervention’ done an episode about a guy addicted to his phone yet? I’ll check my phone.
"For all the advice I hear about letting them fly, I’ve never actually seen a freak flag."
"Famine, STDs, racism, junk mail, murder, BO, public access television: All the worst things in life are free."
"Jokes are similar to pronouns, they’ve been around forever but only get attention if you say the wrong one to the wrong person."
Thank god the Japanese made karate belts white to black. That could’ve looked bad the other way.
"“You are what you eat.” Unless you ate acid, then you’re everything else"
"Sadly, if I had a time machine I’d probably only use it to prove people wrong."
"‘No pain, no gain’ doesn’t really apply to gaining weight."

When people yell at you for simply stating statistics that’s ‘fact shaming.’
You can't win if you're an alarm. People get angry at you when you do your job and they get super angry when you don't.

"Heaven is a dangerous concept. If you think the after party is gonna be amazing, you'll be less likely to make the most of the real party."
"Weed: We’re in everything now! Cookies, candy, brownies! How did no one think to put a fun substance into foods before?!

Rum Cake: but but....

Jello Shot: Let it go man, it’s over."
"Ironically, the person you told that big secret to now doesn’t trust you."
"During a flight:

Lady: Sir you have to listen to me, I’m a flight attendant. 

Me: So am I. Everyone here is attending this flight."
We’re so obsessed with looking down at our phones that we don’t even notice our nose is in the way.
"New relationships feel like an airline. You pick the one that feels right, the more time & money you invest the more points you get. But as soon as there’s a connection you start looking at easier other options online."
It makes more sense to make Felicity Huffman pay for an underprivileged person to go to college.
Sex is the only exercise adults want to do.
"Me: I’m a sensitive guy. 

Friend: Yes you are. 

Me: Ouch, you think? 

Friend: Now more than ever."
"Friend: What’s better than food that’s free range & cage free? 

Me: Food that’s free."
"Women got it right with sex toys. I don’t get these guys with sex robots, why do I need the whole lady? I just wanna get off, now I have a roommate?"
"My friend only eats grass fed beef. That’s how high up we are on the food chain, we decide what we eat eats."
"I bet there'd be a lot less Islamaphobia if they had their own brand of ice cream: ""Praise Allah Mode."""
"Sad when you realize you’re actually not depressed, you’re just lazy."
The lady cop who shot the black guy in his own apt is the modern day Columbus.
It’s sad we wait till something gets stuck in it to ever mention our craws.
I’ll stick with podcasts.

Did Ellen write this one?
A documentary on communist dictators called: “The Power of Mao”
The T-Rex’s arms are perfect for texting. (I need to go outside)
The people you pick on Jswipe or Jdate are the ultimate chosen people.
"Time traveler in the 50s: 

In the future we read fewer books but we all read 1 or 2 sentences at a time from hundreds of ppl we’ve selected & agree with."
"Are sex robots capable of other tasks? They should come with WiFi, Siri & GPS. Can it sync to my laptop? 

Me: Let’s get it on. 

SR: (robot voice) Ok, you have 47 minutes until your dental appt & traffic is heavy. It’s partly cloudy & temp is 78F. Now pound me daddy."
Always a big reality check when an actor portrays someone in a movie then they show the real guy at the end. Yikes!
Sometimes I feel bad for forgetting the ages of my friend’s kids then I realize that’s probably a good thing.
"Leaving orphanage with an infant. 

Lady: Oh my god, so cute & tiny! What is it? 

Me: A rescue."

Alcoholics drink at home before meeting friends at a bar: ‘Pregame.’ I do the same thing with food before going out to dinner: ‘Pregain.’
Not porn.
"Movie Idea:

A terrorist who feels the affects of aging and is nervous about getting older: ‘Midlife Isis.’"
They’ve got no beef.
A 'Kodiak Moment' - That's when you get attacked by a bear and someone gets a picture of it.
When a rich older Caucasian lady educates herself on the struggles of minorities = ‘Enwhitenment’
This is why I cry after hook ups.
Which makes it even more annoying that I wasn’t on purpose.
I don’t get why this is so shocking. I thought we all knew Ellen liked to be inside a box with a bush.
"“I’ve gotta relax, I’ll listen to people talk about a real murder that happened.” 

- Most women"
I don’t stand for ableists
There’s ‘Gen-X’ or ‘Gen-Y’ but this generation should be called ‘Gen-der.’
Instagram baby!!

‘Friendly Fire’ is too nice of a term for shooting your best pal in the head.

"Man, the U.S. Mint is just printing money!"
Biggg fan of the Gaff (@JimGaffigan) & his movie American Dreamer comes out today on iTunes and all that good stuff. I can’t wait to see it. I heard he turned down Thor for this role. Check it out folks!
"If you’re a pot farmer where weed isn’t legal, you’re a grower not a show-er."
"We’re all the same color on the inside, except smokers."
No one ever eats their good feelings.
I wonder if Kool-Aid hates the association with cults or enjoys the free advertising.
I bet one of the perks of being gay is not having to constantly wonder if you’re gay.
"Whenever a guy unearths someone’s offensive tweets, it usually comes out they they at one point had inappropriate tweets as well. Cancel culture is the new ‘smelt it, dealt it.’"

"Having a car is too much stress, it's like having a baby. The garage is day care, a valet is the baby sitter & mine was taken away because I drank too much."
"Asians might be the most impressive group. They’re number one in everything. Therefore, making fun of them is punching up."
Whenever someone looks down we ask “what’s wrong?!” But when someone looks happy we never say “what’s right?”
Someone pulled the fire alarm at my hotel. Every one rushed out in their underwear but nothing happened. So basically it was Fire Fest.
"Years ago we were tricked by beer goggles, now we’re tricked by filters."
My favorite rapper is Plus Size Joe.
A couple finally having that overdue big fight and then reconciling is the software update of relationships.

They’re talking about making microchips to put into obese people that shock them when they think about food. If we have that technology I’d rather use it on pedophiles.

I was shocked to hear that Colin Kaepernick’s home office had a standing desk.
I’m trying to keep a positive attitude but I think diarrhea is ultimately the problem.
"I need to stop these binge watching sessions, I'm almost done with the show 'YouTube.' It's entertaining but a little all over the place."
Does Russia not have Bravo?
I’ve never seen a trans person with bad posture.
It's so sad to me the fish can't talk about this after.
I heard Epstein is well hung.
"If my last name was 'Wade' I'd name my kid ""Rovey"" to make sure he'd be grateful to be here."
"It's hard for a comic to get on tv but I see junkies, criminals, & hoarders on all the time. It hurts more because we're those things too."
"If you’re a man who’s lost more than 50 pounds, you’ve technically had a breast reduction."
"If you try really hard you can accomplish anything, except: sleeping, getting an erection or making friends."

"My girlfriend is just like her vibrator, surprisingly hard to turn on."
Comedy!!
This is the body god gave me and my God is Nabisco.
"I love the scent of a newborn baby, it has that right out the box smell."
"Abortion Debate at diner:

Friend: It's a pancake once that batter hits the griddle.

Me: They're not my pancakes til' they hit the table. 

Friend: No, you can give the pancakes away but they're yours. 

Waitress walks over and drops all the plates.

Waitress: Ah, I miscarried."
Also the most used line at my shows.
"Whenever my little nieces & nephews make fun of my older generation, I eat peanuts in front of them."
"R. Kelly, Epstein, Spacey... So many pedophiles these days. I bet there are more pedos than trans people, maybe they're the ones who should have separate bathrooms."
"Kevin Spacey went from Hollywood to Rome, he really made it to the pedo major leagues."
"1999.

Dealer: Want an edible?
Friend: Whoa whoa, you nuts? You know how much THC is in those things?! 

2019:

Dealer: Want an edible?

"Women: Do not judge me by my looks!

Same women: ...I don't like her."
Just because you're saying the right things doesn't mean you're thinking them.
"Social media the compost of the internet. Periodically, I'll dump something on it & check back weeks later to see what kinda horrible mess has grown. The only difference is compost is good for the planet."
It's basically an extra bathroom.
It's not the size of the country...
Also “we should get together sometime” and “I came.”
One of the perks of being big is you get to call yourself ‘beautiful’ and no one challenges it or accuses you of being arrogant.
"Someone yelled a slur & a lady said “Uh, it’s 2019, words like that are so outta style!” Style? I’ve never seen a guy scream a racial slur and thought ‘Ooh, he’s so trendy.’"
After
Quick hug!!
"As a kid when you sit in a circle, it's always a good time. If you sit in a circle as an adult it means you have a drug or alcohol problem."

"The name ‘Chad’ has a lotta range, it’s either the whitest name on the planet or a country in Africa. There’s no town in Sweden called “Deontay.’"
It’s why I never try to spell this word.
"Oh yeah, I’ll be there baby!!"
You ever so broke you hope someone gets the name wrong and accidentally Venmo's your account.
"A lot of the things women like in the bedroom, they hate outside the bedroom. Try pulling your girls hair in the kitchen!"
Mass!!!
I think it stops being a 'smart car' when it lets me drive it drunk.
"I partied too much in theatre school. My friends got straight A's, I got gay D's."
"Most giraffes reach heights up to 9""11'"
Not for the stranger's apt I'm in.
Telling yourself to 'live in the moment' really ruins the moment.
"They should update the game of Clue and add anti freeze, fentanyl and assault rifles."
"I hate when people comment on what I'm eating. Even as a baby I was like ""Ugh, I don't know who's boob it is, let me eat in peace!"""

"That’s true, I barely remember losing my virginity."
These movements have helped me realize that I’ve been blatantly sexually harassing men for decades.
"Wow, I mature fast."
"Ugh, more gentrification."
Don’t be yourself.
Glad to know I wasn’t the only kid poisoned by my mom.
You know those pants that are stain resistant no matter what you pour on them? That’s how my girlfriend is with compliments. Nothing sticks.
"Think you hate your marriage? Think about all the gays & lesbians out there in traditional marriages. You’re pretending to be happy, they’re pretending to be heterosexual."
Where I went in the Middle East prostitution was legal but porn wasn’t. Weird. That’s like ‘it’s legal to murder but it’s jail time if you watch SVU.’
"My phone is about to die, better get a long Uber ride."
I look at people in loving relationships the same as a guy with nice sunglasses “how have you not lost that yet?”
"I feel bad for Jewish people. 

-Neo Nazi: You're not a white!

-Jews: People hate us because we're different. 

-Black Guy: Maaan, you know you're  white."
"In the bedroom:

Lady: No offense but are you an amateur?

Me: Yeah, wait are you a professional?"
I don't wanna sound like a new guy here but I swear that sometimes the clitoris isn't always where it was last time around.
"Tom Brady does the same thing to his kids as a husband on Forensic Files does to his wife, first a passionate kiss then tosses their limp body into the ocean."
"22 yr old: ""Down with hate!! We need to coexist!""

Same person: ""I hate your act and will work hard to get rid of you."""

Salad tossing is very tongue in cheek.

"In the show Euphoria, the students are played by 20 somethings. That’s unfair to high school aged actors!"
"This brand new car has Bluetooth, keyless entry & satellite navigation yet still has a cigarette lighter. That’s like being super progressive and still saying ‘oriental.’"
"To every teacher & girlfriend who told me I was a horrible listener, I wish you could see how many podcasts I go through in a day."
"My Native American name would be ""Runs From Intimacy"""
Get consent first tho.
"White people used to have a devil & angel on each shoulder that helped them make moral decisions, now it’s a racist and an HR person."

As humans evolve they become more tolerant & taller. But if you see a guy who’s 5’3” no one says “You’re stuck in the past man!”
"Me: How’d you know he was gay?

Gay friend: It takes one to know one.

Me: How’d you know he was racist?

GF: ..."
My parents couldn’t afford anything fun for us. For my bday one year they got us a bouncey check castle.
"If you can easily tell who's gay, you have great gaydar. My friend can always tell who's racist, he has great Radar."
The old age app isn’t factoring in all the people that would’ve gotten plastic surgery.
I don’t care about a black little mermaid. I’d be more sceptical if she was Jewish because a lot of them can’t be around shellfish.
But why can’t you ever order extra gluten?
"You ever read the bible? Man, these stories are unreal."
A lotta folks complain that gay people took the rainbow but no one mentions how the mentally challenged took the word 'special.'

I heard the new black female 007 is going to be played by Scarlett Johansson.
I wonder if the R. Kelly trial will be streaming.
I think it’d sound a lot cooler & more progressive if we started calling biracial people “fusion.”
I think it's more the shape.
Hey thanks fatty. It’s from the surf shop ‘Saturday’s.’
"I wanna make a movie called ""Your Step"" just for the free advertising."
So 'over the counter' means it's on the shelves but things I need a prescription for I actually buy over the counter in the back? Got it.
Many comics don’t like woke people but none more than Cosby.
"My black friend is like my lawyer, I don’t say anything incriminating unless he’s present."

A heterosexual couple having sex on the stairs: “Step Cis”
“He’s got blood on his hands!” is always regarding something negative but it’s not always bad. Could be a doctor saving a life or a care free boyfriend.
Yas queef!
"My privilege is like my bank account, no matter how much I have I get nervous to check it."
I've noticed poor people never need to 'find themselves.'
You never hear about something being furbished.
"College kid: ""I'm not going to listen to a cis white male!!""

Me: ""All I ask is that you show me the same respect you'd show a trans person."""
"It's too bad that unlike men, when women fist fight, one of them never instinctively takes their shirt off before."
"- If you could marry anyone, alive or dead, what would you pick? 

- Dead."
"I agree there's 'beauty privilege' but there's also a thing where I see a good looking person giving a tutorial and think ""Too hot, what could they know? Skip!"""
"Stereotypes are like N'Sync songs, they're all bad yet we know every single one of them."
"I'm bad with money. Whenever I put the bill on my credit card and my friends give me cash, in my head I think I made money."
A good sign humans are lazy is the ultimate praise you can give an enterainer is to stand up.

"If the U.S. can give Native Americans casinos, feels like Germany could've thrown the Jews a few waterparks or something."
You're making fun of ppl for watching wrestling or reading comic books but you love Taylor Swift? All of these things are for children.

Wrestling is the only sport that gets more embarrassing when you become a professional.
And prescription pills.

Through evolution this generation will develop a new muscle that forms from patting yourself on the back.

"Belonging to a bank is like being in a relationship. It's stable, has your back & treats you better the more money you have.

"Some guys call sex without a condom “doing it raw.” Sounds gross & off putting, it’s much classier to say “doing it tartare.”"
Holocaust photos are even more depressing when you remember the camera adds ten pounds.
That’s what they told him. He was actually in a pool the whole time.
Off to the races!!!
You know you have a serious addiction to something when you start bringing it in the shower. For me it’s alcohol and my phone.
You know you dress dorky when even your black friends are strongly suggesting you culturally appropriate them.
The worst is when they get stuck in the machine & you have to stay married.
Life is a marathon. That's why every now and then you shit your pants.
Much like politics.

How long until the black hole gets gentrified?
"Oh you’re on the spectrum??? Yeah we all are, that’s why it’s called a spectrum."
"Not a good sign when I over hear a group talking about attacks, rapes & people in power, I don’t know if their talking about Game of Thrones or the news."
"Random Dude: No one talks to each other anymore! Humans don’t have conversations or interact these days!

Me: Why is this nut job talking to me?"

It’s always awkward when a woman admits she’s wrong because then I have to say “it takes a big lady...”

How you know we’ve got it pretty good in America is our police are overweight. The people who protect us are out of shape. That says a lot.

"If everyone follows the advice of today “Don’t apologize for being you.” “Avoid negative people.” “Follow your heart.” Then we’ll be divided into 2 groups & both will be unhappy. Oh wait, we did that & we are"
Some of the porn out there these days feels like it should have a ref.
"Wine is like tapdancing, I can never tell if it's good or bad."
"Fireman: This is not a drill!!!

Civilian: You're right, it's an axe."
A robot and a machine are basically the same yet I'd rather be referred to as a sex machine than a sex robot.
Japan is a kooky place. Their athletes (sumo) are obese and their competitive eaters are super thin.
I do this every tax season.
"Just heard someone say “politics have turned into professional wrestling.” No way, pro wrestling is way more realistic & the people who follow it are way less angry."

"We treat political candidates like it’s a dating app now. It has to be perfect. “He’s too old, swipe. Heard he’s a creep, swipe. He’s too much like my current guy! Big swipe.”"
My favorite part of an Instagram model video is that 2 millisecond delay when it starts & you can tell she’s like “Oh ok! Be sexy now!”
"Politics have become very medieval. It’s all witch hunts, trolls, caravans, building giant wallls and even a Baron."

Shout out to all the girlfriends out there for picking up those low priced restaurant checks.

"I considered getting rid of an abortion joke because it bothered so many people. My friend at Planned Parenthood said ""What? No way, screw them you have to keep it!!"" Weird, didn't think she'd be the one to say that."
I don't like the term super foods. Eating healthy just makes your body run correctly. If I'm gonna drink spinach and celery juice I want powers.

The word ‘gay’ has a lot of range. You can be called ‘gay’ for ordering a frilly drink or posting a pic of you and your girlfriend.

I assume the biracial samples at the sperm bank are called ‘mixed nuts.’
"Honey is one of the few things that never goes bad, that’s why I think it’s a weird thing to call your spouse."

"This lovely middle aged woman is keeping me from freaking out on this flight, she's an emotional support cougar."

Some ppl don’t understand how a man could be attracted to another man but I don’t understand how anyone could be attracted to dueling pianos.
Shhhhh!
Pumped for this puppy!
I bet they’re high & just misplaced it.

If I were a war general’s horse I’d be secretly excited to be included in the statue.
The king!
"Just a heads up, people are gonna die every year."
This would’ve really changed Men in Black.
‘Cannabis Lube’ sounds like a bad guy in a Star Wars movie.
It'd be a lot more effective if you could assign New year's resolutions to other people.
Cosby would not approve of Louie’s material.

Comedy is the only job I’ve had where I can kick someone out of an establishment for talking to me.
Glad I got out of childhood before Toys R Us closed.
"New year: I’m gonna eat right, quit drinking & become a better me.

"Kevin Spacey: If I give you some money can you help me make a video in my kitchen?

Teenage Boy: Ugh, what you were doing before was less weird."
I’m jealous of those families that do the “pretend to look sad” photo.
It’s so expensive to eat at the airport. Just to get in there you have to buy a flight.
Libertarian shoes
Now the classic holiday tradition of watching comedy movies & pointing out the jokes that would never fly today!
I wish I was always as creative as I am when I'm worried about something.
"If you’re dodging someone’s text, don’t watch their Instagram stories. Apparently, they can see that."

"The phrase: ""I wanna see other people"" is the only time ""see"" means bang. Otherwise it would be a lot weirder to hear “I see dead people.”"
I could be a decent person today but I’ll just wait till the new year.
Seeing a well groomed person in public looks very civilized yet seeing someone groom themselves in public is horrifying.
"People always say to me “know your worth!” I don’t know. My self worth is like my account balance, sometimes it’s better not to know. I’m just gonna keep livin & hope I don’t overdraft."

That’d be great man. Thanks. Let’s hug!!!
"I never got the homophobic guy who’s like “I don’t know how any dude could take it in the ass” but when his GF decides to do anal, it’s his birthday."
It’s weird gyms aren’t considered fat shaming. If I was fat I’d rather someone insult me than pay a monthly fee & go to a building to make sure they don’t look like me.

"Going to someone’s house just to hook up is that same awkward feeling when you sit down at a buffet and both think ""how long do we wait before we start?"""
Good vibrations.
Both were but in different ways. Fun morning
Oh yeah? Well I think the term “crossing the line” is offensive to immigrants.
"Sometimes I wish I had a clitoris. A delicate thing that can feel amazing if stroked just right but it's so sensitive that if you poke at it too hard it stings. Oh wait I do, my ego."
Emotional damage is the one kind of ED that actually makes you better in bed.
"Trump should just buy a license plate company, then all the same people will technically still be working for him."
Why can’t girlfriends also dwell on nice things you said?

"Best ways to fall asleep: Ambien, melatonin, the Office."
Just be yourselfie.
It's weird to refer to the less fortunate as 'needy.' Are we talking about the homeless or me in a relationship?
I like the loud fast one
A lot of women get no credit for stopping their boyfriends/husbands from wearing horrible outfits. Those women are all unknown heroes.

The one upside to brilliant scientists getting popped for sexual misconduct is now there's an even greater motivation for them to invent a time machine.
"Thank God for global warming, it won't hit anything."
Social media is like looking in the fridge over & over. You know there's nothing good but you check it so many times that eventually you start consuming things you don't even like.
A tsunami hitting Alaska!?!? You've outdone yourself this time Jews.
"Football is like my religion, I'm still never sure when to stand & when to kneel."
I'm gonna start wearing my neck pillow everywhere in case people start telling me about politics or their kids.

Perfect for the holidays folks. 'Napsack' brought to you by ISIS.
"I bet little people really enjoy going to Starbucks. ""Here I'm not small, I'm a grande!!"""
Say what you will about man boobs but pretty much all of them are real.
You know that feeling when you put your hand out and no one shakes it? My super power would be feeling that all the time.
"Ever since the popularity of dick pics, I'm hearing the phrase ""the camera adds ten pounds"" a lot less."
Can there be one pair of Siamese twins in a movie that have similar opinions?
If a guy has sex with an animal is that a get for the animal? Like do animals consider us gross or do they think humans are out of their league?

My friend prefers to be called “big” instead of “overweight.” But you’d never say “It takes an overweight man to admit when he’s wrong.”
I just had romaine!! Lettuce pray.

"Weird you need a marriage license. Driver's license I get, you get pulled over & they check it. Do people even check the marriage license? Next time I see a broke fat guy who tells me abt his wife, I'm gonna say ""Lemme see some I.D."""
"Adjectives that sound great to describe food are usually terrible if they're used to describe guys. 'Flaky, cheesy, moist.'"

Ooh good question !!!
"They say soy milk is better for you. In that case, on the carton, they should put pictures of kids we've found."

A musician 'unplugged' is nice more intimate performance. A comedian unplugged is a raving lunatic.

"""Blood is thicker than water."" That depends. Is the blood from a drunk guy and is the water from Flint?"
Remember when you'd have an hour long conversation with someone and not include an ad?
"Today I woke up & looked at my phone then did work on my laptop, watched TV, then went to see a movie. My whole day has just been gradual progression of bigger screens."
"If I don't drink for a while my hand shakes. If don't look at my phone for a while, my pocket vibrates."
I had no idea they knew each other.
I love to drink alone and it's sad I can't ever share that with anyone.
We talk about substance abuse a lot in America but no one brings up people's crippling addiction to Chapstick.
Hairloss pills only help keep your hair not regrow it. I want hair but its weird spending money to keep something I already have. It's almost like my hair is a gold digger.
Ohhhhhh yeah!!
RIP Stan Lee. He manufactured so many fictional heroes & creative stories he could've worked for the news.

"My uncle doesn't think trans or climate change is real. I'm not surprised cus the Earth is basically transitioning. My argument is the same for both ""Oh it's happening & you gotta admit, much hotter now."""
Horror movie idea: Air Bnb host that wants to hang out with it's guests.
It’s kinda cool to know that some people you’ll just never see again.
It seems like a lot of the folks who say “I don’t care what other people think” totally should.
"Weird, what was she doing at someone else’s house?"
I think it’s easier to kidnap someone than it is making a kid nap.
Exactly!
"Yikes, I’m just glad he didn’t say “Forest management, you’re fired.”"
Always blows my mind when someone doesn’t realize they suck as a person because that’s all I constantly tell myself.
"I switched from my regular toothbrush to an electric, I feel like Bob Dylan."
"A girl said she never wants flowers because they're just gonna die anyway. By that logic you should never get batteries, pets or have kids."

I think the caravan is gonna replace the circus as the thing kids threaten to run off and join.
The caravan should definitely be sponsored by Fit Bit.
Well I guess this frees Jeff Sessions up to be the next Colonel Sanders.
I find it hard to call anyone who wears a robe to work 'your honor'.
Funny when two groups argue over who has it worse. If it gives you so much power to be a victim why would you want to improve?

If Megyn Kelly wears black face on Halloween I hope an old white lady calls the cops on her for taking candy without a permit.

That’s brutal. She may have been the first person to burn their Nikes.
‘Confirmation hearing’ is insensitive to deaf people.
I look at gay men the way I look at marijuana. Years ago I thought ‘not for me’ but now that it’s more accepted I’m like “Why not dabble? Hand over that grinder.”

"Churchill died of old age, musta been a milk dud."
Bill Cosby is going to prison. I guess he'll be placed in a sleeper cell.
This lady on my flight is such a hypocrite. She has an anxiety dog and yet she's acting all weird around my service Muslim!
"I'm not a bad sleeper, I'm great at sleeping. I'm actually a bad 'lay in dark silence consciously with own thoughts-er.'"
"You always hear ""when you fail, get back up and keep trying."" They never mention that people make fun of you the whole time."
It's always a relief when the guy you publicly hate is your same race and gender.
They always tell you 'do what you think is funny' until they see what you think is funny.

I think the most talented minority group has got to be the left-handeds.
A guy proposed at the Emmys! Next year I'm hoping for a live emancipation at the Teen Choice Awards!
"If a guy gets horny he can watch porn & not be horny anymore. Too bad when a girl wants more commitment, she can't rub one out to a wedding magazine."
Kellyanne Conway is great in Ozark. So terrifying.
A high end men's wear store with no staff: 'Suit Yourself'
"You'd think if there was so much fake news, more of it would be positive."

"Out of all the human senses, you're really only allowed to look and listen to strangers. Smelling gets weird and tasting is illegal."
It's way scarier now to tell a white person a racist joke than a black person.
"I look at dogs the way I assume women look at penises. It's scary if a strange one's coming at me but if I know it's owner & it's had it's check ups, I'll let it hump me."
They say a text message gives you a shot of dopamine similar to cocaine. At this point I need 10 retweets & 100 likes just to feel! I'm on black tar heroin and a butt plug baby!
You’re the reason I get outta bed in the afternoon.
I don't want to work out at a gym full of people who want to be there.

"I know someone's more successful than me when what they put in their hair is better than my actual diet. Avocado, apple cider vinegar & coconut oil."
A man sexually assaulting a woman is a dick move.
I'll be really impressed if we figure out how to make new born babies cordless.

"Yeah, give em hell! Praise Allah!"

Oh no!! My flight was cancelled!!! Come to the 945 show!!!
"Having a woman compliment your penis feels good, having a black guy compliment your shoes feels great but the other way around, nothing better."
"My ex girlfriend was like a porn star, horrible dialogue."
nahhhhh
Calling a woman you know a ‘Goddess’ is a nice compliment. Calling a dude you know a ‘God’ means you’re in a cult.
I need to stop accidentally sending the texts to the person I’m trashing.
"“Victim” is the human version of ‘shes a rescue.’ Sometimes it’s true, sometimes it’s dramatic effect."
My auto correct is like a controlling boyfriend. It keeps changing all my words like it knows what's best for me. I'm getting Phone-splained.
You know what’s the worst part about forgetting a brilliant idea? You never forget that you forgot it.
It’s too bad there’s not a silencer for gun debates.

"In Indonesia, do kids play “the floor is lava?”"
"I wouldn’t say we worship our phones, if that were true then we’d have a little funeral every time it died."
Relationships are like trail mix. Most of it isn't great but there are a few treats throughout and the parts you don't like are probably good for ya.
I don’t know much about street gangs but I assume the Bloods attack about once a month.
"It must be hard when an Italian person becomes a vampire, no more garlic."
The only time you should smoke an E cigarette is after you've had sex and faked the orgasm.
I'm drawn to people who don't like me. I think it's because we have so much in common.
Haha. “Show me a permit!!”
"It’s great women are supporting each other now more than ever, especially because that means giving up their most instinctive skill of insulting other women."
Isn’t it about time Crayola changes it to “pencils of color?”

Most Insta and Snapchat filters are just a digitized version of beer goggles.
"""You do you"" sounds nice but basically translates to ""go F yourself."""
"Studies show that shorter men have harder lives & make less money. So when women say ""I want the same treatment a man would get!"" I think 'Ok but you're still only 5'3"".'"
Whenever someone refers to themselves as a 'citizen' they're about to start complaining.
"Remember as a kid you'd run to the car and yell ""Shotgun!"" I never see that anymore. The only time kids yell that now is in school."

Guy: Weird that you refer to hanging out with you as 'work.'"
"*Lands in new town*

Billboard: ""You have to check out our aquarium!""

Why? Do fish look different in your city?"
"Weird that ""had him eating outta the palm of my hand"" is about you controlling someone. You metaphorically served a guy food with your hands as the plate."
"If everyone just spliced in some knowledge, poetry or a work of art in between their insta stories, we might all be a tad more cultured."
I can only assume black people get together and laugh hysterically about awkward handshakes they've had with white people.
"I get so nervous about people thinking I'm racist, that I don't complain anymore when my avacado turns brown."
A girl told me she's not wearing make-up because being the real you is brave. I like that. I wanted to be brave too so I stopped pretending to be interested.
"If you don't want to be the center of attention, don't order the fajitas."
This sums up the night perfectly.

"Lesbian friend: You're not attracted to Asian women, are you racist?

Me: No but you're not attracted to men, what do you hate men?

A good name for synthetic marijuana: ‘Crock Pot.’
You can tell a person’s self worth by how thick their toilet paper is.
"Anytime I see a guy with the word “Hustle” on his clothing, I know he’s got nothing in the works."
A new term for consensual sex:  “Permission Slip.”
"Whenever you're next to someone talking on the phone in public, that person is never the listener."
"Whenever a woman refers to a guy as 'traditionally handsome,' that means he's good looking to people dumber than her."
Does the suicide hotline accept text messages yet? I think making a phone call would push me closer to ending it.
Everyone assumed my friend was homophobic when he wouldn’t hug a gay guy but I knew he was just autistic.
Always weird when a New York audience member gets offended & yells at you. Why were you so quiet around the guy on the sidewalk literally masturbating?

"Yoga is great because it benefits those who do it & those who don't. People who do it are more relaxed and people who don't, enjoy your pants."
Don't yell 'fire!' in a crowded theatre if the movie was just ok.
It'd be fun to watch a coked up person go back & forth with an auctioneer.
"Whenever I see 12 people go ""WOOOING!"" passed me on a peddle pub, I hope they all get DUIs."

It's weird that Wal-Mart sells guns but Target doesn't.

Plants and pets in your house are only good if they were by choice.

"Whenever someone says “Anyone can make a difference,” we always assume it’s a good thing. Bad people make differences too. Stalin, Cosby & Jared Fogle made huge differences."
I’m shopping for an armoire and the hardest part about it is having to constantly say ‘armoire.’
"See Papa John’s, it’s all in the delivery."
A racist white girl with a huge ass has a long life ahead of her.
No one cares about skinny people’s feelings. I’ve never seen a shirt that says “Thin is Beautiful!”
You shouldn’t judge a woman by her looks but we shouldn’t act like women don’t like being considered pretty. I’ve never heard a wife or gf say “you never tell me I’m smart anymore!!”
Overly PC people who try to get you fired for saying an inappropriate word are like bad cops who put someone in jail for life for smoking a joint. They don’t understand intent & abuse their power.
It’s interesting how women are scared of strange penises yet they still like big ones. I’m scared of dogs but if I meet a nice one I’m not like “thank god it’s huge!”
‘Aids Ribbon’ is my least favorite ice cream topping.

It'd be nice if your amount of horniness was a direct correlation with how smart you are.
When a gay friend only comes out to a few select people I call that a “soft opening.”
Gulp...
I'm working on something in September. I'll keep you posted baby!!
Thank god our genitals don't need adapters when we travel overseas.
"Unlike politics, at least with racial tension people will pretend a little. I've never heard a liberal say ""What? Some of my best friends are republican!"""
"My reaction towards PDA really depends on the attractive level of the couple.

The scariest people I know are so nice & sweet on social media. And the meanest people online are so nice when I meet them.
I would never neg a woman unless that's short for neglect.
"Whenever someone tells me that if they were to commit suicide, they're gonna ""do it in style,"" I hope they do it sooner."
"A weird thing about men is when another guy humps your butt or pees on you, you know you're actually good friends."
Whenever someone asks you what the word 'subtle' means just point to the 'b' in that word.
The doctor told my sister in law that she's pregnant with quadruplets!! He was four-shadowing.
"The word ""Minority' always gets associated with race but it just means a smaller group. So it's fun that racist people don't realize that they're a minority."
"If you hear that a bunch of people have been talking about you behind your back recently, that just means you’ve been being genuine."
"Ironically, the fathers who are rarely around are the ones who hear ""stay at home Dad"" the most."
"I had to change a joke because it might offend a porn star. I think she'll be able to take a joke, from the footage I've seen she could probably take 2 or 3 at once."
If people are cars then racists are stick shifts. There’s a lot less made in America than before and they give me anxiety in urban areas.
"DC  friday and sat, skanks on sunday"
Sex with your spouse is like owning your favorite movie. A random hook up is like catching your favorite movie pop up on tv.

I hate baths but I love a pool. I love a shower but I hate the rain.
"In America, telling someone they have a fat ass can be a compliment or an insult."
"Things are so much easier now than they used to be. 15 years ago, you woulda had to rip your phone off the wall to drop it in the toilet."
Sticks and stones will break my bones but words will get me fired.
Seeing Roger Rabbit pull Jessica really gave me hope as a goofy kid.
Imagine someone telling you about a soccer game in dream they had.
I wonder if lactose intolerant men are subconsciously less into breasts.
"If Joey Chestnut was gay, he'd be in high demand."
Italians are 'off-white people.'

"I just heard the term ""skinny privilege."" Something can't be a privilege if it's attainable by exercising. I'm sure black people would take a spin class if it meant not getting pulled over."
Catching your girlfriend watching lesbian porn gets a much different reaction than catching your boyfriend watching gay porn.
Sure. I’m here a lot. Check out my show every Tuesday or look at the cellar website for spot times. Lchaim!
If we don’t let the kids out of the cages then I don’t think it’s right to eat them.
"If you’re in a small cage, it makes it almost impossible to stand during the anthem. Mixed signals."
My ex pushed commitment as hard as creepy guys push sex. I used to worry we’d out be drinking and I’d wake up in a church with a tux on.
"Don’t throw a party for someone for losing a ton of weight, there’s cake at parties."
My dentist sounds like the grand wizard of the kkk. “I see a lotta color but the goal is to get them all straight & white.”
"Uber is going to cease giving rides to drunk people. But that’s who needs it most! What’s next, Planned Parenthood will start slut shaming?"
"When someone has a baby, a chemical is released in the brain that makes you think no one else has done this."
"When someone is learning how to use Photoshop, is there a part where they teach you how to be mean?"

"I like my women like I like my haircuts, high and tight."
The coolest part of seeing every girl's dad picture is you can see why they like their current boyfriend.
"Don't feel bad if you're a single dad without a job, God is too. #Happyfathersday"
Just realized there's no Father's against drunk driving. #HappyFatherDay
"I'm so happy for my friend! He met a nice girl on that Jewish dating website, Paypal."
Yeah but you get less results when you dust for nipple prints.
Reading about these controlling and abusive boyfriends makes me feel better about always being distant and apathetic in past relationships.
"Hair loss medication is more romantic than dating apps. Tindr & Bumble are about new beginnings, hair loss pills are all about holding onto what you already have."
Coffee is the only drug someone can stop doing and people won't assume it was because something horrible happened.
"Horrible name for a dairy but pretty good for a sperm bank: ""The Creamatorium."""
Quitting bread is going against the grain.
"Babies are fun because you can just put them to bed when they start crying. Can't do that with your partner. ""Sorry, I forgot your bday honey. I know, I know. Shhhh."" (Picks her up & walks into other room)"
"Everything in moderation, including sobriety."
"The smallest minority is the individual. Now whenever someone says they hate me, I tell them they are racist."
Telling a woman her body is a work of art is nice and yet telling a lady she should be in a museum doesn't really go over.
"It's good that certain people quit drinking but some people should start, there's a lotta bad sobers out there too."

"I'd just like to get to a level of confidence where if a person I don't like, doesn't like me, I can still function in society."
If I was into golden showers I'd hang out near jelly fish.
"My deaf friend wouldn't shut the hell up, so I put him in handcuffs."
A great thing about boobs is they're usually both appreciated equally.
"You know what I love about cheap peanut butter? You can't spill it."""
"Anytime someone says ""Well that's your opinion."" They weren't happy with your opinion."
"Men look at prudeness the way women look at cheapness. ""Jeez, let loose and live a little."""
"An app where you take a picture of what ever you're about to put in your body, burger, beer, cigarette, etc and it tells you how much time it'll take off your life."
"If you wear a shirt and no jacket, it's casual. If you wear a jacket with no shirt, it's terrifying."
"Crazy to think that before the internet, people just did good things without posting about it."
"I have no problem with burgers, I’ve just known IHOP for so long. Now I understand how people who grew up with Bruce Jenner felt. #IHOb"
The International House of Burgers sounds like a distinguished family in London that didn’t approve of the Markle wedding. #IHOb
So sad about Anthony Bourdain. I'll miss him. I wish he could do an episode showing us the cool spots in the afterlife. #RIPAnthony
"I typed 'Hollywood' into my GPS and it said ""you'll never make it."""

"Sometimes I wanna be friends with someone so badly I try to move the friendship process along way too quickly. I see them at a party & say “hey man, if you ever need a ride to the airport, I got ya. You ever get sad?"""
"People are the opposite of sausage, we enjoy seeing how they’re made."
"""I have plenty of black friends!"" I love how we assume being friends with someone in a group means you don't hate the group. I have many close friends who are improvisers, I love them but definitely not a fan of their group."
Being a fugitive would be terrifying but it’d also be kinda nice knowing a group of people are constantly thinking about you & working really hard to know where you’re gonna be.
"Getting a job in Hollywood: 

50s: Changes name from Moshe Schwartz to Mike Smith. 

2018: Changes name from Bob Allan to Dashiki Nodarapist."
I like the term 'sex worker' because it makes the rest of us volunteers or pro boner.
Weird we have Yelp for restaurants and bars but nothing for people's personalities.
"Like most relationships, iPhones work for about 3 years."
My penis size really fluctuates based on how the girl feels about me at the time.
"Stores for heavy set people are proof that women are more subtle than men. 

Women: Lane Bryant

Men: Big & Tall"
Nothing brings back prayer in the classroom like a school shooting.
As I get older my testicles look more and more like the scales of justice.

"If Roseanne was on ambien, was Jared Fogle on baby aspirin?"
How was Jesus so lean with all the breaking of bread?
Whenever I have a big secret I only tell my black friends because they don’t crack.
You rarely hear about Asian people committing crime. If I were Asian I’d mug someone and say “no one’s gonna believe you.”
"Comedian makes joke about politician = internet on fire. 

School shooting = Again? Bummer."
“Samantha Bee or Roseanne?” is just the new laurel vs yanni.
What an elaborate way to learn the definition of the word ‘feckless.’
You shouldn't use knowledge to seduce a woman because knowledge is power.
"Whenever someone gets called racist, no one ever asks ""against which race?"""
Tennessee Rep says porn is the main cause of school shootings. But kids are being shot not choked.
"I read that sex is a great work out. I agree but that’s not a great pick up line at at a bar though. “Hey, wanna lose some weight?”"
Remember when ‘anal leakage’ was the worst medication side effect?
"You should never force someone into sex. You should also never force someone into marriage, especially because that's in front of their parents."

A Venmo style app but for apologies.
Whenever someone tells you “know your worth” they always assume you’re worth something.
My girlfriend has 86ed 69ing.
I bought a giant Costco pack of belgian waffles. I eat three square meals a day.
"You learn more from mistakes than anything else. Because of this president, we’ve all learned so much about American government!"
I did not know that. That’s fascinating. Thanks for explaining it and not chewing me out. Now I know. Thanks
Well they’re not all the same.
Is this offensive?
"My friend Sarah: So gross how men use their power to seduce women. That being said, my turn offs are broke men under 6 foot."
If I had a gun in the house I’d probably shoot my coat rack a lot.
"Animals aren’t as annoying as humans. Planet Earth would be a lot less enjoyable if when something unfair happened, all the animals had to discuss it."
You never hear about the guy who's at his first rodeo.
"Audience member: Youre white, what do you know about racism?!!?

Me: Are you kidding? We invented it."
Why don't airplane seats get banned for fat shaming?
"When you tell an 'offensive' joke now, you look like a mob boss talking to his goons. ""Meet me in a parking lot at 4am, don't get tailed, there's bloggers everywhere."""
"Whenever I approached a girl at a bar I always assume she's thinking ""Ugh, why can't he be taller?"""

I have no faith in you changing the world because you couldn't even do it with your personality.
"If you get caught being racist you get ostracized from society and your name is ruined, proof that shaming does work."
"I always worry about what other people think of me. Then my friend says ""Dude, no ones thinking about you!"" Well, that's even worse!"
Breakfast in bed means someone cares about you. Dinner in bed means you're so very alone.
"For women, smiling at a guy is like giving your email to a business, they'll never stop bugging you after."
"If someone tells you to get out of show business, it might not be an insult. They might just care about you."
Whaaat? Shoot me an email.
Boycott? It should be ‘person-cott.’
My straw doesn’t reach the bottom of my cup. Now I get the frustration women get from a small penis.
"School shootings, so sad. They are America's menstruation.  Addressing it makes people uncomfortable, it happens once a month and it means certain kids won’t be here now."
I appreciate you giving so much to charity but don't forget the people around you. Be charitable and fake a good mood.
"I believe women should always be treated equally. So when I propose, I'm spending two months rent on something for both of us."

Can we also air the Royal Divorce? Feels like that would be more fun to watch.
"The three things I'm most scared are gonna get me are: ISIS, cancer & the rhythm."
It's weird you need a license to get married and not to have a child.
I didn’t know who DJ Khaled was until recently. Weird to become well known because you won’t perform oral.
Just passed an expensive clothing store called ‘Anarchy.’ If I break the glass and steal all merchandise they kinda have to understand.
"I like pizza because it’s a good way to teach kids shapes. It’s starts as a circle. Regular slice is a triangle, Sicilian slice is a square and for the advanced class later, it becomes a cylinder."
Hey thanks Rup. That was nuts. I was  so confused. I appreciate you having my back. Wish I could’ve seen you go at her. She’ll go home and think we’re the bad guys. Comedy!
Blizzards are too cool for school.
“This is America” is a brilliant culturally significant statement about our country and also what my racist uncle yells at immigrants.
"Umbrellas are like sex toys. You forget about them until the situation calls for it, they’re designed to get wet and I found mine on a bus."
"I read that sex is a great work out. I agree but unlike a gym, you need to find a willing partner. No one judges you for paying a trainer."
haha. Same
"When a marriage isn't working out in India, do the parents also arrange the affair?"
"""Person of color"" would be hard to explain to a child.

Adult: He's not a POC, he's white.

Kid: But isn't white a color?

Adult: Uhh... Not for people.

Kid: So I'd use the color white to draw a white person but it's not a person of color?

Adult: Let's get you on adderol."
"In the office kitchenette.

Lady: ""It sucks that if I talk about my period I have to worry about grossing out a bunch of men.""

Man: ""Yeah, it sucks if I talk about my penis I get fired."""
"I can't stand the guy who's too nice during a trash talking session. ""If you can't say something mean, don't say anything at all."""
"If ya think about it, the word ""extraordinary"" doesn't sound that great. It just sounds like something's 'extremely normal.'"

The coolest part of seeing every guy's mom picture is you can see why they like their current girlfriend.
Gotta be awkward at planned parenthood today.
The only thing more open minded than being bisexual is sleeping with objectively unattractive people.
I bet most husbands and boyfriend's know what their partner's vagina looks like better than they do.
I wanna show my appreciation to all the black Uber drivers that see my profile pic and switch it to 'whiter' music. It doesn't go unnoticed.
The fruit around your dessert is like the celery aside your wings. It's just there to make you feel better about what's really happening.
We constantly tell each other ‘love yourself’ & ‘be confident with who you are.’ But whenever you meet anyone super sure of themselves we think “what a delusional psycho.”
"Why does everything have to be racial now?! I saw a couple making out & the guy saw me & lost it. “What, you got a problem with interracial couples!?!” No, it was hot. I’m not racist, I’m a creep."
Now that’s a fun fact!!
Isn’t the word ‘boycott’ sexist? We should personcott it.
The president feels like a baby and the news is a baby monitor. We’re all exhausted by it but need to know if something horrible happens.
Abortion is just birth control for procrastinators.
It's fun when a dad and his baby hit that sweet spot in age when they have the same hairline.
Fun fact: If you text while drunk driving you actually even out and drive perfectly.
"Breweries are fun because you get to see how the beer is made. Not everything is like that, slaughterhouses or a strippers childhood."
Every year we make amazing advances cinematic effects yet only in comedic movies do we go backwards. You always hear “you could never do that joke nowadays.”
Does watching a Stormy Daniels porn count as being politically informed?

Eating your boogers is a gateway to cannibalism.
We act like North Korea is so crazy but we're not that different. We're also a divided nation that worships  someone named Kim.
"On the wall at this gym: ""There's no excuse for not working out."" They just said I couldn't work out because I was wearing jeans. So there is one."
"It's kinda sad when a friend says to me ""come on dude, you're better than that."" Because it just means he doesn't know me that well."
"I'm watching what I eat. I'm still eating horribly, I'm just very aware of it now."
"I put off so many things, I wonder how many times flights have been delayed because pilots just 'weren't feeling it.'"
"I worry about my friend, he works out obsessively and he's an alcoholic. Either way, he's not happy unless he's got a six pack."
"My friend is overweight & says he's discriminated against. When most groups, blacks & gays, are oppressed they march, he won't even walk."
"Therapy is more important than the gym. Yeah, having abs is nice but I'd rather not be the guy having a meltdown at Red Lobster."

Taking your phone off the charger to let someone else get a charge is the land version of giving someone a hit off your scuba oxygen tank under water.

"- What's it gonna take to end fat shaming?

"Bars are fun because it's the only business where you go, consume their product, leave, vomit and happily return at another time"
"Republicans & Democrats should stop fighting over their differences and instead bond over their similarities, like how neither side can take a joke."

"In Israel, it's mandatory to serve time in the military. In America, it should be mandatory to go to therapy. Although, it seems like those should be the other way around."
I didn’t think Michelle’s set was that offensive. She kept it very PC. She was correct about politics.

"In Israel, it's mandatory to serve time in the military. In America, it should be mandatory to go to therapy. Although, it seems like those should be the other way around."
I didn’t think Michelle’s set was that offensive. She kept it very PC. She was correct about politics.

“That’s what the kids are saying these days.” = ‘Something a black person came up with.’
"I had a joke bomb while getting a massage, she wouldn't stop rubbing it in."

"A great comedy special would be Bill Cosby going around prison telling inmates ""watch your language"" & ""pull those pants up."""
I can’t stomach fat shaming.
"Whenever a woman hears the line a guy used to meet his wife, they always say “Awww, that’s so sweet!” It’s only sweet because it worked out, all the other times he tried that line it was considered harassment."
"My ex wanted to get married more, so why should I be the one to propose? What if I did that with stuff I wanted? “I want a thressome but you have to ask me, get my parents approval & also get me an expensive jewel.”"
I love the hobo who gets angry at you for not giving enough money. What a concept. “This stranger didn’t give me an adequate amount of money for not doing anything!”
It’s so amazing having someone in my life I can be truly myself with. Horrific for them though.

My cousin told me I have a gambling problem but he just got married. Even I know those are bad odds.
"I used to look at guys with fanny packs & think ""ha, what a wuss."" Now I realize if he's got the guts to wear one, DO NOT mess with him."

Getting rid of a man bun is the best way to cut carbs.
"Every morning: ""Hey, I'm alive! I lived another day!"" cut to ""Ugh, life is hard."""
It’s wrong that overweight people are discriminated against but they’re also the only oppressed group that can stop prejudice by laying off carbs.

I'm doing cognitive therapy now. I told my shrink I was afraid of heights and intimacy. So he took me up in a hot air balloon and had sex with me.
Every strippers stage name should be her Venmo username.

Having children is the only thing you get congratulated on that most people try to avoid or can be done by accident.

How do women know how to be sexy when they're on top? Is there a class? If a gal was looking up at me I'd probably panic & do the Macarena.
People say looks aren't everything but there's no Tinder for personalities.
Ouch.
"I'm constantly worried about letting people down. Even if I had a peeping tom staring into my window, I'd start acting sexier."
"Ironically, kids who's parents only feed them free range chicken rarely do anything outside."
"We're hard on children. ""So easy even a kid could do it"". But kids can do a lot of things I can't do. First of all, most kids are sober."
Never been to a sex club but it seems similar to uber pool. A bunch of weirdos looking for a quick ride & hoping they get off first.
I just walked past a strip club with Halloween decorations. If you wanna scare people at a strip club just put pics of the girls' kids.

I don't think I'd mind a stalker if they were nice.
If you work at the beach is your screen saver just pictures of offices?
When I'm super horny I finish in two seconds. When I'm super hungry I take way longer to orgasm.
Just once I'd like someone to tell me I resemble somebody without it being wildly insulting.

Saw a guy at the gym eating pound cake. If you're trying to get thinner maybe don't eat foods named after what you're trying to lose.
I really like carrots but can't stand carrot cake. It's pretty much the same way I feel about black people and wiggers.

A drop of grease on your clothes is a good reminder to eat healthier. No one has a quinoa stain on their shirt.
The only thing neo nazis and Antifa can come together on is their love of combat boots.

"If diamonds are forever why associate it with marriage? It should be a passport, they last 10 years, reup if you want or flee the country."
People tell me I'm 'afraid of change.' But I'm only scared of bad change. If you upped my salary I wouldn't be terrified.
You can tell how old someone is by the speed they unwrap wrapping paper.
Getting a bunch of blackout drunks into a car feels very similar to putting leaves into a garbage bag.
I get the most patriotic when I'm filling something out online and I get annoyed at how long I have to scroll down for 'USA.'

Gay guys really think outside the box.
I wanna hire my black friend to give a visible thumbs up or down when I make a joke so white ppl only get offended on behalf of themselves.
You never see a hobo with box wine. And yet they are very familiar with both things.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't get stoned.
Having a gun show right after the vegas shooting is like putting up a water park in Puerto Rico.
"Guns became legal before they could do this much damage. It's like approving of Trump from seeing him in Home Alone 2, NO one had any idea."
"I need to stop these binge watching sessions, I'm almost done with the show 'YouTube.' It's entertaining but a little all over the place."

"I just watched my black friend tell a random girl ""how bout a smile?"" Seems a tad hypocritical based on all the pictures I've seen of him."
I think I have baby fever. Every time I touch a baby I feel sick.
Remember that couple that would film themselves having sex just to make it interesting again? That's all of us now but with life.
"It's hard for a comic to get on tv but I see junkies, criminals, & hoarders on all the time. It hurts more because we're those things too."
"My friend got wasted in Vegas last weekend, spent like 100k, cried & was eventually taken away in a car. She really regrets getting married."
I'm drawn to people who don't like me. I think it's because we have so much in common.
Hefner was a big civil rights activist. The only thing he hated more than intolerance was pubes. #RIPHugh

That was smart of the golden rule to make it: 'treat people how you wanna be treated' and not 'treat people how you treat yourself.'

Feet are gross and kids are cute yet it's considered way less gross if you're turned on by feet.
"I love when people say ""do millionaires really need more money?!"" It's not about need, they want it. Do fat people really need more snacks?"
"What's more embarrassing at this point, having HPV or a VCR?"
Its a beautiful moment when you're standing in the middle of an insane department store and you realize that online shopping exists.
It takes real skill to make fun of someone so your friend can hear it but the person you're insulting doesn't.
Smiling is the only facial expression strangers call you out for not making.
"Obesity kills more people than starvation in America. I guess cuz it's easier to give a guy a sandwich then it is to say 'slow down fatty!"""
"Old folks are the most offensive people ever, they shouldn't be online. Adult sites say 'must be 18' twitter should say 'must be under 80.'"
"They say a relationship works best when the guy likes the girl way more. In that case, I'm not sure why all my amazing relationships ended."
"At the grocery store, the Nutrition Facts are like tinder bios for food. ""Hmmm, the picture looks good but it's clearly bad for me."""
It feels like comedy is more popular than ever right now. That's a great sign for me but a horrible one for the country.
"I used to not understand why people hate winter, then I realized it's because other people enjoy leaving their homes."
"If you're crazy and annoying, it's a 'blog.' If you're crazy and dangerous, it's a 'manifesto.'"
I love a flat screen tv but trying to turn one on without a remote is like a preteen boy fondling his first gal.
A woman with defined arms either means she does hard labor for a living or she's rich and famous.
"Some guy said I was racist for not having any Spanish friends. Why racist? No, I'm actually just unpleasant to be around."
I wish I had the self esteem to turn the brightness all the way up on my phone.
"Crazy that you can have keys copied no questions asked. You have to say your name to get in an Uber but access to a home, that's 68 cents."
"""See if you hadn't been so cheap your sex wouldn't have been awkwardly interrupted.""

People love being called 'unique' but get angry if you call them 'not normal.'

"I'm no expert but 'cat' seems like the worst kind of burglar. He quietly breaks in, licks itself, lays on warm laundry then stares you down."

"If I'm in a restaurant and I hear a baby crying, why do I need to turn around and look at it? I know what a crying baby looks like."
Years ago after a one night stand the girl said 'Buy me lunch so I don't feel like a whore.' You wanna do that by bringing money into this?

"Before black people were in America, were white teens ripping off Native American culture? ""I just got those new moccasins!"""
I always complain about people texting at my shows but I guess it's better than a guy in the front row actually writing a letter.

"They have a higher threshold for pain, can survive bleeding for days, live longer & can make people. On paper, women sound like super heroes"
Some people get their best ideas after meditating or from listening to music. I do all my best thinking when other people are talking to me.
Muscle weighs more than fat and it's a lot easier to get rid of.
I've eaten this entire edible arrangement and I don't feel high at all!
Girls in their twenties are the only group that have to say 'it's my actual birthday.'
Chick-fil-A takes so long to eat because of all the fries and the time it takes to convince the group you're not homophobic.
I look at my phone like a loved one which makes me nervous because every few years it gets smarter and changes holes.
"I poured water into my wallet, shook it up but unfortunately that only works on shampoo."
My phone auto corrected 'slut shaming' to 'slut shaking.' Now I'm not sure which is worse.

"If I can have an open container on a plane and a train, why not in an uber?"
I'm so angry this guy at the gym is using the machine I was going to sit down and text on.
"I'm surprised you don't see more homeless in airports. Free bathrooms, you can sleep and you're not the only one who can't afford the food."
"Girl: ""I like when guys call me 'sweetheart.' Why don't you guys do that anymore?""

Me: ""Because of women."""
You can tell a lot about a person by how they treat an elevator button.
Some people claim to have no friends because they're socially awkward. Is it possible that you're just unpleasant?
"The barista asked me what cup size I preferred, I said ""a full C."""
"During sex people scream ""ooh baby!"" quite a bit. We're using condoms & you're on the pill. Strange to yell out the one thing we don't want."
As a white guy I'm loving just sitting back watching this Indian family go against a black family on Family Feud. No dog in the fight!
"The closest I get to having multiple personalities is texting with old friends, girlfriend, parents, new friends and coworkers all at once."
"Uber driver: ""So you're an introvert? Wow, tell me about that.""

Me: ""Well, that's not really how it works."""
"I'm having trouble deciding who is worse, the guy who says ""that's what she said!"" or Isis?"
Weird how white privilege is the only privilege we talk about. Every group has perks. There's black privilege. I can't wear a purple suit.
Guy was livid cuz I bumped into him reading my phone at the Apple Store. Thats like getting mad if I accidentally grazed your ass at an orgy
"Before iPhones, I read a lot more backs of cereal boxes."
I know a girl who spends way more money than she has. She identifies as rich but can't make the transition.
The fruit around your dessert is like the celery aside your wings. It's just there to make you feel better about what's really happening.
"The year is just a number, it's your life  that kinda sucks."

"""Well now you know how it feels!"" is the exact opposite of progress."
It's totally normal to say to your partner 'Ooh baby' but insane if you say to them 'Ooh teenager.' Why is one age creepier than another?
People always say 'he's big timing you because he's insecure.' But being insecure is the reason I don't big time people!

"""Out of sight out of mind"" doesn't really apply to the vagina."
"At Thanksgiving this year, I'm praying me getting caught masturbating gets brought up and not the election."
Being skinny is similar to being white. You're allowed to make fun of them and people just assume you have no problems.
"At restaurants, forget smoking and non smoking sections. They should have 'pants on' and 'pants off sections.'"
You can't tell me to live in the moment and save for my future.
I haven't seen so many white women this distraught since Ross cheated on Rachel.
"Whenever a kid kicks in a woman's stomach, she always says ""he's a little soccer player."" Apparently, there wasn't a goalie."
"A lotta people ask me how I stay so thin, Soul cycle, cross fit, kettle bells? Nope, just good old fashion anxiety. It's the best cardio."

My charger is broken. I had my phone plugged in and the battery is less than where it started! It's like I'm in an episode of Black Mirror!!

I feel like I hear a lot less about ninjas than I used to. I guess they're getting better.
"Your hands carry the most bacteria of anywhere on your body. Weird custom to start with a handshake & if you're a gentlemen, a kiss."
Some people get offended when you make fun of a group. I think it's offensive you assume that group can't take a joke.
"Ok, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover but you should definitely judge wine by its box."
"""Well rounded"" sounds like a PC way to say overweight."
"I see @JonahHill has a new movie out. I like that guy, he's a good actor. I've stuck with him thru thick and thin and thick."
"When I'm too busy to hear a long story I say ""storage full."""
"I call my friend the ""Mexican Whisperer."" Not because he knows how to speak to them but because whenever he says 'Mexican' he whispers it."
"You never hear about a person being ""high key."""
"Tonight catch me @colbertlateshow cracking wise in a suit! Its a dicey set. Thanks @CBS, hell of a network! Tune in!"
I've run a few of them and I'm still not even positive what a 'muck' is.
You ever say a line and someone mishears you but what they assumed you said was actually way funnier and you just go with it?
'Butt' and 'booty' basically mean the same thing but there's a big difference when it comes to calls.
"Everyone is on board with the term ""you snooze you lose"" until you use it referring to endangered species."
The saddest thing about Rock N Roll is that there's no more wild 'rockstars.' That terms only used when Peggy at the office works overtime.
You wouldn't know it by the outrage. But publicly calling someone a biggot or a homophobe is way more damaging than calling someone a slur.
One of my imaginary friends is black.
Aren't all phones technically headphones?

"If you figure something out and I ask how you did it and you say 'magic,' just know I hope you disappear."
"People always tell you to 'be yourself.' But what if you suck? Some of you please, be phony."
"Man, starving to death would be awful but at least there'd be one point close to end where you looked really good."
I'm so indecisive. If I had a child I would name it then a few years later I'd rename and hope it didn't notice.
"We don't give ourselves enough credit for learning to read. The thing you're doing right now, you learned that!"
"Black culture is really the only culture people take from. You never hear someone say ""Be yourself man, quit trying to act Dutch!"""
They say English is the hardest language to learn. And we all did it! We should be proud of ourselves!
"If we're gonna change words for political correctness reasons can we start adding ""to me"" after you say somethings 'not funny.'"
People get less angry If you bump into them while you're reading a book than they do if you're reading your phone.
"You can start a sentence with 'boy' or 'man' but why not with anything female. Youd never be alone in a room & say ""Girl, it's hot in here!"""
"Uncircumcised men get made fun of a lot, thankfully they have a thick skin."
Buttholes are tinder profiles for dogs.
I go through a lot of books on tape. I'm very well listened.
A lot of people were glad when Bin Laden died. I was happy when people stopped saying 'biatch.'
"I'm too selfish to be racist. ""Oh, you're Mexican, so how does that effect me?"""
"Based on how much we enjoy it, it seems like 'cheesy' should be a compliment."
"If you party hard people call you a 'rockstar' but rock is dead. From now on we should  say ""This guy drinks like an ex reality tv star!"""
"They say racism is taught, just like languages. And with both, if you forget it you still only remember the really bad words."
I know I'm doing better in life when I type 'p' into my browser and @pandora_radio pops up before @Pornhub.
A big part of my life is running outta the bathroom before the person on the phone hears the toilet flush.

How come you never see any groups of dudes with one lesbian friend?
"Avoiding eye contact, zero care for things around you & unresponsive. Not surprised when I heard the man who created Pokemon has Aspergers."
"I just passed a furniture store called  ""Comfort Zone."" Well, I'll always be outside of that place."
The internet router has now passed the Nintendo as electronic device that needs to be restarted the most.
It's amazing we still have cooking shows. Haven't we cooked everything by now?
How come there's never male pattern baldness in facial hair? I've never seen a beard comb over.
Get this fatties album. It's a doozy. His pod ain't bad either. Enjoy!   @JoeListComedy
A big reason we stare at screens all day is because it's the only thing we communicate with nowadays that doesn't judge us or get offended.
Why does backspacing a word feel like it takes so much longer than typing it?
"We're attempting to make progress toward racial harmony and that's great. But one thing we all have in common, is mistreating ugly people."
"The first guy to ever bite into a lemon and say ""we could do things with this."" That guy was open minded."
"For a group that some people consider unnatural, gays are the only group who's flag appears in nature."
They say cleaning is incredibly therapeutic. That must be how hotel maids get thru the day.
Calling a guy 'a zero' is an insult. Calling a girl a 'zero' means she's thin.
Its cool if you like a man 'that goes after what he wants.' Just make sure what he wants isn't illegal and is over 18.
My phone is constantly auto correcting 'haha.' It's like it doesn't think my friends are funny.
"Boobs are the only private part that changes with weight. If that happened with male genitalia, I'd only eat carbs."
Racism is similar to Nickelback. It's fun to joke about but I hate seeing it live.
Repeating something is called 'parroting.' Being fidgety is called 'squirrelly.' Can't we just call going thru my exes trash: 'raccooning?'
"Christians used to hate rock music, now there's christian rock. It just takes time to win 'em over. Looking forward to ""Christian gay porn."""

"The words ""good"" & ""pretty"" are both nice compliments. You'd think putting them together would be double nice. ""Your show was pretty good."""
20 years ago kids would ride bikes all day and adults would sit down at a computer. Nowadays it seems exactly the opposite.
"""Everybody rise! Now kneel! And back up! Be seated. Then I'll come around & splash some water on you.

"When you see your gf talking to a guy then you learn he's gay, it's a relief. It's the opposite feeling that guys dad had when he found out."
"The Fourth of July, for a lot of us, it's the only time we see our friends during the day."
Voting for trump is like getting a tramp stamp. It seems fun now but eventually you'll regret it can't take it back.
"For some reason, being patriotic seems offensive. And that's a really bad sign."
Conditioning my phone to not auto correct curse words is the closest I'll ever get to raising a child.
I can't keep up with P.C. It used to be 'stupid' now it's 'learning disabled.' It used to be 'retarded' now it's 'mentally gay' or whatever.
"Women say ""men are dogs!"" I also hear that 'dogs are man's best friend.' My best friend is a man. Ok, it all checks out!"
"It's very confusing to put an apostrophe in quotes. ""'"""
"I never really think about what color a person is, until the handshake."
"You always hear ""my internet's down!"" It's not YOUR internet, it's THE internet. If it was yours, you'd have some explaining to do."
Booze from the bottle or ice cream from the carton. Why does not using a separate container make it look like you've got a problem.
I wonder if pop stars from the 70s and 80s get excited or annoyed when one of their hits comes on when they get put on hold.
You can just ask to differ. Seems dramatic to beg for it.
"When crickets tell each other jokes, they must assume it's going terribly."
"The word ""coagulate"" sounds like what it looks like."
Sometimes I get so angry that I  misspelled one letter that I'll backspace the whole word and start again.

How come no one ever points out when an era begins?
"""Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels."" 

-Said by no one in the holocaust"
"""Blood, sweat and tears"" is a fun band or a description of the night I lost my virginity."
It sucks that herpes is permanent but confidence isn't.
"'Comfy' is just a shortened version of 'comfortable' yet it can't always be used the same way. ""I'm not comfy with you around my children."""
We prefer text to speaking to each other so much that we've actually invented ways to show emotions with punctuation. :)
I lose a little love for someone when they tell me a quote acknowledging what day of the week it is.

No, they're not."
"Minorities often get offended if you say they look like another person of that race, unless that person is attractive."
"Oddly enough, it feels kinda therapeutic to cancel therapy."
Most people can't figure out crop circles or stone henge. I can't wrap my head around the soul patch.
"Is cat calling less offensive if you use old timey terms? ""Yowza!"" ""Gee wiz!"" ""hubba hubba!"" (Wolf whistle, loosens collar, howls at moon)"
"Had to wipe my ass with a newspaper, now I can't read the horoscope but if those things are at all accurate it'd say ""today will be shitty."""
The guy who invented the high-five must've known he was on to something when he immediately celebrated by doing one.
Word choice is so important. I love a good Butterfingers. But I bet I'd eat less of them if they were called 'Margarine Digits.'

Teens like to shorten words and they're very PC. PC words are longer. I think 'totes' was created to balance out 'physically challenged.'
Women's heads aren't as clouded with sex as guy's are. Woman's brains are like men's right after the guy has masturbated.

"Saying ""I'm offended"" is the adult version of ""I'm telling!!"""
"Much like Prince, ethnic groups keep changing names. ""The group formerly known as Oriental."""
"Women are the only people who can say ""we are definitely not having sex"" then yell at you for not having a condom."
Teens like to shorten words and they're very PC. PC words are longer. I think 'totes' was created to balance out 'physically challenged.'
Women's heads aren't as clouded with sex as guy's are. Woman's brains are like men's right after the guy has masturbated.
If you use 'gay' as an insult people assume you are homophobic. But if you use 'pussy' as an insult no one thinks you hate vagina.
Boobs are the only fat on a woman's body that you're allowed to agree with her she needs to remove.

You're making fun of ppl for watching wrestling or reading comic books but you love Taylor Swift? All of these things are for children.
I helped my friend behind his back. I really threw him over the bus.
"If you want a girl to leave you alone, tell her you'd like to sleep with her."

"You rarely see a woman with a traditionally perfect figure say ""I love my body."""
The term 'smooth talker' basically translates to 'horny liar.'
The kids in Mrs. Doubtfire were very insensitive when they saw the transgender person using the bathroom.

Instagram is a fun platform for posting pics but it's a great app for notifying people that you're on your phone and avoided their message.
This girl from a trailer park keeps sending nice tweets my way. I think she's head over crocs for me.
"Alcohol is the only drug people pour out for dead friends. You'd never do that with cocaine. ""Look, I love Greg but this is expensive shit."""

This restaurant is letting me build my own burger. I feel weird about it. Who am I to play God?
"I love when white people get offended on behalf of blacks. It's amazing, we've even found a way to gentrify their feelings."
"People let themselves go in a relationship like bananas. When you're available at the grocery you look good then once they move in, 'gross.'"
Genitals are the opposite of food. With food you don't want to get to know 'em before you put them in your mouth.
Interesting how it's ok for a girl to tell her boyfriend he doesn't talk enough but it's insulting if a guy tells his gf she talks too much.
"From what I've gathered, a 'feel' seems to be the only thing that gets 'copped.'"
"In the bible, shrimp is more of a sin than homosexuality. That means Christians would be better off seen at a gay bar than a Red Lobster."
"Most of the people reading this are objectively unattractive. Even if you're thinking ""not me,"" statistically speaking, you have to be."
The coolest part of seeing every guy's mom picture is you can see why they like their current girlfriend.

A pic of a hotel room online is the opposite of a pic on a dating site. When you get to the room you hope it's bigger than in the photo.
Gays are the only group that doesn't get in trouble when they only date their own kind.
You can tell who the submissive one in the relationship is by who does the googling.
I was surprised when my friend took a job at a bakery because she's gluten free. That's like being a gay gynaecologist.
"Trump would be a surprise, mostly because a lot of people hate surprises."
"People say ""tequila makes me fight!"" No, it's just alcohol. No one says ""black tar heroine makes me groggy but regular heroine I'm fine."""
You not answering the phone is the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Sometimes when I get lonely I turn on the DVD commentary and pretend those are my friends talking during the movie.
Sometimes I write 'Sent from my iphone' on the bottom of my regular emails just so it seems like I've left my apartment...
"Women: Stop judging us by our looks! 

Me: Sorry. 

Women: Oh you're dating a girl now? Can i see a picture?"
"Thanks autocorrect, apparently now I'm an ""orgasm donor."""
"My iphone is broken & won't charge. That's like a kid that won't eat. ""I'm just trying to give you energy! Also,  sorry I dropped you."""
"""Men are so gross, they'll put their penis in anything."" Don't be so judgemental. Statistically speaking you've been some guys 'anything.'"
I'm a comic & luckily girls like a funny guy on a date. Girls also UFC guys but they get in trouble if they do their talent on a date.
"You never hear anyone say ""God dammit, I'm NOT turning into my father."""
I can't leave the house because YouTube videos keep automatically loading. The only thing worse is a bowl that automatically repacks itself.
"If there were support groups for ugly people, they'd be empty."
Relationship goal: Become as comfortable talking in person as we are in text messages.
"My friend said ""You couldn't pay me to watch The View."" Hmmm, that'd be the easiest job ever. He's a furniture mover. He should reconsider."
Everyone has prejudices. Even the most liberal open minded person talks about frat guys and republicans like a grand wizard.

It's really trendy to have holes in everything you wear now. Let's hope that doesn't move toward condoms.
"The cool part about coming out as a bisexual is you can say it while leaving. 

You: Mom, I'm bi.
Mom: What!!?? 
You: I said bye! (Leaves)."
If you're black and someone calls you 'the man' you're a cool guy. If you're white & you get called 'the man' you've ruined something fun.
"There's now office, doctor & gym porn. All places I don't wanna go. What's next, DMV porn, old folks home porn & friend's play porn?"

"If I see a pretty girl behind me at @ChipotleTweets, I'll get the guac just to show her I'm a good provider."
"I don't send dick pics. It's not impressive enough to register on a phone. My dicks's like an indie band, you have to see it live."
My landlord is a broken record. He's black and doesn't work.
For sober people 4/20 is just another day. Kinda like Father's Day for orphans.
"The phrase ""God hates fags"" is so irrelevant. I'd be more scared of a sign that read ""Bill hates fags!"" I'd be like ""Crap, is Bill here?!"""
"If Harriet Tubman could be here today, she'd proudly say ""Thanks but what is money?"""
"""It's all about the Tubman's!"""
"They say 'sexuality is fluid.' Well I should hope so, otherwise it would really chafe."
"Eh, I'll vote tomorrow."
No one ever implies anything if you don't have any Asian friends.
I bet a lot more people would vote if we could do it online.
"We blow our language load now. If something kinda sucks, it's 'the worst.' If it's ok then it's 'the best.' Like this tweet, it's the best."
I just bought a new wallet with money I carried in my old wallet. Then I put the change in my new wallet in front of the old one. Ouch.
"Squirrels have the qualities you want in a roommate: Quiet, never see them doing anything sexual & never notice them going to the bathroom."

"Foreign countries brag about knowing all U.S. politics. But it's not because you're smart, it's because our politics are incredible tv."
I'm drawn to people who don't like me. I think it's because we have so much in common.
"""God hates fags!"" So what? What has god done lately? Gays can't reproduce and they're still here. They don't need God."
The people who seem to care the most about their 'turf' are gangs and gardeners.

"The best way to progress or end a relationship is to say ""I love you."""
You know that feeling when one of your friends betrays you? That's how I feel when I check my phone and it wasn't charging the whole time!
Performed at a benefit against Objectifying women. Great cause & an all female crowd. I was nervous so I pictured them in their underwear.
"Pretty impressive, we've done a full 180. Being homophobic now can get you in the same trouble as being gay did 50 years ago."
"If you're in the Al Qaeda and you're phone rings, I wonder if they say ""I'm blowing up!"""
"Thankfully celebrity impersonators don't do the bad stuff too.

""Noooo!"""
"Women probably have no idea but every male, at some point, has had an imaginary fist fight in his room."

I used to see a guy with a twirly moustache and think 'gay villain' and now I think 'mixologist.'

You never see a female 'junior.'
Sure it's takes a tough guy to say when he's had enough. But isn't it kinda tough to bottle everything up and never mention it? No? Ok.
"A girl said she never wants flowers because they're just gonna die anyway. By that logic you should never get batteries, pets or have kids."
Sure it's romantic when a guy writes a song for you ladies but then you have to sit there while he plays you a song.

A girl told me she could tell I was older because I used CDs and punctuation.

"Man, even Chris Rock's jacket is white. #Oscars2016"
"How bout these people who post on Facebook 'anyone wanna hang out?' Wow, that's the social equivalent to telling a waiter 'surprise me!'"
I've always hated talking on the phone & now it's rarely done. Hopefully other things I hate will go away too like chatting with relatives.
"""Let's paint the town red!!""

"Sure, I dropped off a lot of coins but I wouldn't say I'm a 'star.'"
"I love when you answer the phone and your friend says ""Hey it's Greg."" Trust me I know, I was just weighing the pros and cons of picking up."
"FaceTime isn't a form of communication for me, it's more of an eye contact obstacle course."

"Nothing scarier than when your friend says ""you've gotta see this"" and puts a screen in your face."
A girl told me she'd never date a guy who cries. Well guys don't wanna date a girl who cries either but at least you ladies have the option.
I'd like to see a 'Scared Straight' type show but for people who take a while to text back.
I don't know the stats but I bet meditation took a dip after smart phones were invented.

"People always say ""you should hang out with my friend, he's really cool."" I don't wanna hang out with a cool person. That sounds exhausting."
The jukebox is a crazy concept. I'll pay a few bucks and have the entire bar listen to what I like against their will and without a say.
"Nothing more defeating than the word 'Ok.' ""I just got promoted to CEO and my wife's gonna have our baby!!!"" ""...Ok."""
"A friend took a while to text me back saying 'sorry, I was in the bathroom.' In that case, you should've written back immediately."
There's no more satisfying place to check your phone than on a weight bench.

On Facebook you can't have more than 5000 friends. In real life my limit is maybe 4.
"""I have a wet dream!"" 

-Teenage Martin Luther King Jr"
Hitting the refresh button more than 3 times is a good sign you need to get out of bed.
"I hope this lady who just screamed ""too much information!"" never hears about Google."
People who object at weddings are terrible. Not because they object but because everyone knows about weddings a year in advance.
"I have a theory, not that many people are into peace, they just don't know what to do with their hands during photos."
Alcoholics are just depressed people who aren't a bummer.
The term 'fun size' doesn't work the same way on male genitalia.
"My alcoholic friend is like a rescued kitten, he needs shots."
"People talk about bisexuals the way other people talk about Bigfoot. ""Personally, I don't think it's a real thing."""
The only thing harder than being a caveman is being a caveman that needed glasses.
A Netflix password is like an STD. You got it from the girl you're sleeping with and now you're constantly staring at your laptop.
Nowadays your kid could get called racist if he has no gay or black imaginary friends.
"If you're cool with a Jonathan, you call him 'Johnny.' So if you're cool with 'transgendered' people, seems like you should say 'tranny.'"
"Kids are horrified by the idea of their parents having sex. So why don't parents use that as a threat? ""Clean this room or we're gonna..."""
"How come you can draw eye-brows  on your face but if I draw abs on my gut, I'm a weirdo?"
On the terrorist watchlist can we add 'people who's Instagram is solely photos of their face?'
If I owned a restaurant I'd only hire girls in their 20s to work in the kitchen. Completely eliminate the chance of pubes in the food.
Everyone thinks they're the first person to tell you 'you're going to hell.' I knew I was going 25 years ago but thanks for the reminder.
It's a bittersweet moment when you get tossed out of a bar so fast that your Uber is still there.
"Relationships are like a game of monopoly. It's fun at first, then gets really drawn out, I eventually cheat and you throw an iron at me."
"On Facebook now there is an ""interested' button. I have yet to push it."
"When Google was invented, I wonder if they knew a major use of it would be for girls to know if the guy they're dating is a murderer."
"Most of my inner monologue: ""You're being too quiet! Say something you idiot! Oh boy, shouldn't have said that..."""
My New Years revolution is to be more conscious of auto correct.
I'm definitely more ageist than I am racist. I'd much rather see a Muslim on a plane than a baby.
"The lesson of ""don't talk to strangers"" was definitely coined before dating sites were invented."

Someone's 'face lighting up' used to be a good thing. Now a face lights up because they're bored and staring at their phone.
An A on a test is the best grade. AA means you're an alcoholic. AAA means you're stranded on the side of the road. The fewer A's the better.
"I have a weird brain. I don't think I'm an ugly guy but if you told me I was, I'd believe you."
Whenever someone asks you what the word 'subtle' means just point to the 'b' in that word.
The sonogram is the only picture of a naked male that everyone is excited about.
This girl told me there's nothing sexier than bravery in a man. So I mentioned I went to @ChipotleTweets twice last week.
"I don't want a tattoo, mostly because I don't want a conversation starter."
Things women find sexy are way more acceptable. Women like men's arms & it's totally ok to just grab 'em. I can't do that with camel toes.
It's confusing because you don't want to be judged by your looks but it also feels really good when people call you 'pretty.'
"""I hate games.""

Every middle aged woman in south Florida looks like Selena's manager.
"What a day! Sorry Jews, nothing personal but it's just a superior holiday."
It's about that time of the holidays where I help my mom put all the food away and she asks me if I'm gay.
It's never a great gift when you hear 'it's the thought that counts.'
How come you never hear about 'African-Canadians?'
"I know it doesn't seem like it but 
sometimes your phone dying is the best thing to happen to you."
"If you are ever worried you're not on anyone's radar just remember, no normal person has a radar."

The phrase 'good for you' always sounds condescending. Imagine hearing that after sleeping with someone.
"Girl: ""Men are creeps, all they think about is sex.""

Guy: ""True but that's what got us to meet and ultimately fall in love."""
You know you're older when you keep forgetting to not put spaces in your hashtags.
Star Wars in 3D is brilliant because since we all have to wear glasses we all look like nerds.
"Must suck to be a doctor because you can't call in sick. If you did they'd just say ""well then you should come by the hospital."""
It's an interesting moment when you're eating at a crowded joint & a stranger asks to sit next to you and you pretend it doesn't bother you.
They say 'violence is never the answer' but what about during a crossword puzzle?
"Let's enjoy all this positive Star Wars excitement now because by this time tomorrow, it's just gonna be complaining & whining."
Comedians feel about the PC police the same way black people feel about the real police.
"If you're ever hungry and horny at the  same time, the only way to be satisfied is to breast-feed."
It would be so hard to butt dial 20 years ago.
A girl bragged to me she met her husband 'IRL' which means 'in real life. That's not good when reality is no longer the default.
It's an odd thought but we should all be incredibly thankful that young children don't get horny.
"Wouldn't it be great to give people 140 characters in a conversation? ""Sorry, you've hit your limit, I can't ingest anymore."""
"It was so smart of girls to make sex a moral thing. I hate small talk but if ppl bring up the weather I can't say ""Sorry, I respect myself."""

"Trump is flying too close to the sun, his hair is starting to melt."
"Whenever a guy describes his personality as 'take it or leave it,' I'm always so relieved that one option is 'leave it.'"
A group of girls were all talking about how much they hate dick pics & one girl said she'd never gotten one. Then they all made fun of her.
Using politically correct terms is like when your friend kinda forces you to call him a nick name. It'll never fit like the old word.
The word 'hack' must have a great publicist. I didn't hear it a year ago and now it's consuming my life.
Any hump is a dry hump if the girls not into it.
'Tangy' is a great word to describe food and a terrible word to describe genitals.
It's weird. I hate small talk and yet I love talking about minutia.
You never see a wealthy guy putting quarters in a roll.
There's so many apps for getting into relationships yet none for getting out of one.
Just once I'd like to hear about jogger raping someone.
"If I ever say something stupid or offensive in a conversation and things get tense, I immediately say ""can't believe trump said that!"""
I'm pretty sure I'll be killed by a drunk driver. I'll be that driver.
On a flight I said 'I bombed' & the stewardess told me 'don't say bomb on a plane.' Then I said 'my friend murdered' & she said 'nice job.'
"I just thought to myself 'you never see pop up books anymore.' Then I realized 'Oh right, we have ipads now and I'm an adult."
When lives are lost we say 'I'll pray for you.' But you'd never accept that if your boss lost your pay check.
I have a lot of pretentious friends on social media which is great because I love random quotes.
My favorite part of travelling is not leaving the hotel.
A girl on a date asked me to tell her 'something I've never told anyone before.' That could be a romantic secret or a terrifying confession.

"A guy called me a 'sociopath' yesterday. If that's true, how come it hurt my feelings?"
You can tell when guys have no rhythm because when music comes on all they can do is mime the instrument in the song.
My friend had no profile pic on his Instagram account. It's all photos! That's like having a LinkedIn account with no job.
"When you say ""My thoughts and prayers are with you"" you're basically saying: ""I thought about it and I pray this never happens to me."""
When someone says 'let's get together at 8:15.' It's sad how important that '15' is to me.
Salad tossing is very tongue in cheek.
"If a girl on a date tells you she isn't wearing underwear, you think 'sexy.' If a guy says the same thing, you think 'uh oh, what happened?'"
We tell everyone to 'go with their gut.' I think we should do background checks before we tell just anyone to do whatever feels right.
"Aside from an alcoholic, you rarely refer to anyone else as 'raging.'"
Still not sure why I can't 'spend this all in one place.'
"Remember when 5 minutes was a tiny amount of time? You used to say ""gimme like 5 minutes!"" Now I can't imagine watching a 5 minute video."
"In movies, cracking someone's neck always works perfectly every time. You never see a guy like 'hang on, lemme try again. I had a bad grip.'"
So fun to eat like an average American yesterday.
I always feel uncomfortable when I'm the only guy not in a conversation. Then I get in a conversation and think 'I'd kill to be outta this.'
Around this time of year I avoid casinos. Too awkward.
There should be a way to bottle wifi. Absorb it when you have it then use it later like glow in the dark.
America is a weird place. Gasoline costs less than guacamole here.
"I bet a lot of henchmen are just playing dead. They don't care about world domination, they're just on the payroll."
Girls love when a guy takes time to send flowers or write a note. And hate when guys take time to shave body parts.
"Remember, just because someone doesn't care about YOU, it doesn't mean they're not nice."

The guy who calls it 'cutting a rug' is rarely good at doing it.
Proof I need to meet a lady and slow down on comedy is that my phone always corrects 'kissing' to 'kidding.'
"""I want a guy who's taller than me, when I'm in heels."" So I not only have to be taller than you but I also have to trump your lie?"
How come it's totally fine to call someone a 'dirty blonde' but if I refer to a guy as a 'filthy redhead' I'm a dick?
We all want long lasting batteries until the smoke alarm goes off.
You appreciate something the more you worked on it. That's probably why my parents don't care if my adopted brother runs with scissors.
Don't keep a hairstyle because you got a lotta compliments on it. Compliments can be something ppl do when they don't know what else to say.
"When someone says they're voting for trump, I get the same feeling as when someone claims a place is haunted. They've lost all credibility."
2 weeks ago a lot of women would've definitely chosen to sleep with Charlie Sheen over Bill Cosby.
"Why doesn't hair color divide people the way skin color does? ""Did you hear about Sally? She's dating one of those dirty blondes."""
"You ever hear a sentence that doesn't make sense but still kinda does? I just heard one: ""Man, I am so gay for this chick."""
"If you think you don't profile people, think back to anytime you've been on an airplane watching people walk toward your seat."
"My hipster friend said his dad is 'set in his ways.' Yet my friend owns a pocket watch, only listens to records & rolls his own cigarettes."
"What do Jewish men say when they are the main provider in the family? ""I bring home the non pork product."""
"People are always confused because I only yell ""there is a god!"" when something bad happens."
"If you fall asleep on a train, they just keep going. Thank god planes don't do that."
How come we always assume being lonely is worse than being in a bad relationship?
"If you ever want some alone time in America, just take the stairs."
"Maybe one day I'll know what 'albeit' means. Although, I probably never will."
Your body alerts you when you have to pee or vomit. Why can't your body alert you when you're about to leave the house in jean shorts.

I think they got the idea for Parmesan cheese from a guy with a really bad dandruff.
A lot of New Yorker's have framed pictures of New York City hanging on their walls. Just go outside.
"You ever feel like no one notices you? You know how when it's 11:28, people say it's 11:30? I feel like I'm 11:28."
"Girl: Sorry Mark, I don't want to be official. I don't like labels. 

Me: But your jacket says North Face."
Cops are like smoke alarms. They are there to save our lives but they can also really ruin your night.
"Homeless people love cool cities. NYC, Miami, San Fran, LA. Yet I go to Omaha, Nebraska and everyone's doing fine."
Porn is the only entertainment where I get an immediate urge to do what I'm watching. If I'm watching hockey I'm not dying to fight on ice.
"Man, I would hate to play outfield on a baseball team. All that free time and you can't check your phone."
It's amazing that some people are so homophobic that they make signs. I've never made a sign in my life. I'm not prejudice or productive.
"Whenever a girl says ""I really like funny guys"" all I hear is ""I really like free entertainment."""
"Add the word 'American' to a place & it sounds less offensive. African-American, Mexican-American. We're so full of ourselves here."
"Adjectives that sound great to describe food are usually terrible if they're used to describe guys. 'Flaky, cheesy, moist.'"
"People tell me 'you can't like someone until you like yourself first."" Well, that's never gonna happen because I'm not gay."
These smartphones are outta hand! I was just about to yell at a kid on the sidewalk for staring at his phone and then I got a text.
"I had a small yeast infection recently, or as I call it a ""micro-brew."""
Orlando!! I'm headlining the @backbooth on the 5th! Get tickets now because not many are sold! Gonna be a hoot!
"Bad Sentence: ""Oh yeah, you can totally tell that kid's gonna be hot one day."""
"As a comedian, I love when people laugh at my jokes yet I'm terrified when strangers laugh at me and I don't know why."
Facebook just posted a photo of me from five years ago. It's a nice reminder of how little I've accomplished.
Unless a number ends in a '5' or a '0' I can't do math.

"It'd be fun to make a zoo with people that are named after animals. The exhibits include Cougars, black panthers, pool sharks & pigs (cops)."
Getting a retweet from a guy with one follower feels less like a compliment and more like the beginning of a cult.
"Years ago in scripts there was always ""Fat Girl 1."" You can't say that now. So because of fat shaming, overweight people are losing work."
We've come a long way. Fifty years ago a guy had to hide the fact that he was gay. Now a guy has to hide the fact that he's homophobic.
"I blacked out one night & my friend said ""So you didn't brush your teeth at night!?"" Hmm, I'm more worried about the gimp mask I woke up in."
I ask a lot of questions that make everyone uncomfortable but they still really wanna hear the answers to it.
"So crazy you can have a baby on accident. Thank god other big responsibilities aren't like that. ""I blacked out, now I'm surgeon general!"""
"If I was hiding from the police, I'd blow it by forgetting and sending out a silly tweet."
"Women are better than men. 
Lady: ""He cheated on his wife? Forget him."" 
Guy: ""She cheated on her husband? I probably have a shot!"""
Always fun when you're really thirsty and the water fountain is barely pushing out water and you have to perform oral on a spigot.
"Date you? Im sorry, I just want you to like me."
"Can't I just be romantic, do we need to throw 'hopeless' in there?"
"Daily reminder: If a person doesn't laugh at your joke, it doesn't mean they hate you!"
So your persona on the internet is mean guy that hates everything? That's really cool.

If I shake my iPhone it undoes everything. Same with a baby.
"An older lady hit on me by saying ""I'm gonna kidnap you tonight."" That's something that sounds a lot different coming from a guy."
Whenever I check my voicemail I'm happy 99.9 percent of the time I didn't answer the phone.
"If a girl texts you ""I want you so bad!!' Trust me, don't write back ""Badly."""

Why can't women be as obvious when they're interested in you as they are when they're clearly not?
"My pillow was approved by the National Sleep Foundation. I'd love to work there. 
Me: ""Sorry I'm late, I overslept""
CEO: ""Promote this man!"""
It seems like certain people have kids just so someone will hang out with them.
"Things that have gone out of style: baggy clothes, tongue rings and punctuation."
You rarely hear about a damsel that's not in distress.
"If you ever want honest fashion advice just bump into a black teenager. ""Watch where you're going with those corny ass shoes!"" I knew it!"
Fat guys must hear a lot more when they 'listen to their gut.'
"I wonder if dogs would make some changes if they could give each other tips. ""No need to spin 3 times before sitting, it's pointless."""

"If you get offended when people make fun of your group, don't make a big deal or some new term for it because then we want to do it more."
I just passed a thick book about dyslexia. That seems cruel.
When I watch action movies and they're beating up and running from bad guys. I always think about how many calories they're burning.
I would play with your mole if you'd let me.
"As you get older, you really start to worry less about ant piles."
"A guy said to me ""why watch porn when you can have sex?"" Same reason I watch sports, they're much better at it than me."
Porn is one of the only performances that we watch a lot of but can rarely get tickets to a live show.
"My buddy Dale is like a vitamin, I'm never sure if he's working."
This girl I was seeing last year always called me 'pumpkin' because she knew she was gonna get rid of me at the end of the season.
"People interact so little these days, the romantic thing you can see nowadays is two people sharing ear buds."
"It can be hard to be a guy. Depending on the situation, you can get yelled at for getting an erection and also for not getting one."
"People always say ""he died penniless."" But penniless doesn't necessarily mean poor. I'm sure Bill Gates doesn't have any pennies."
I guarantee I can drunk drive better than you can text and drive.
"At a dinner party for my date's parents, the dad asked me what I was thankful for and I said ""not being attracted to kids."" I'm single now."
The term 'casualties' seems a little too mild for what it is.

"A girl on a dating site said to me ""I'm not a piece of meat!"" I know, I'd never get meat online."
It's sad that people who died before the 2000's will never know the joy of a retweet.
It's amazing how hard people work on their looks and not at all on their personality.
How long until there's a 5 second ad played right when a woman undresses in front of you?
When you think about it 'brainwashing' doesn't really sound like a bad thing.
People always complain that TV sucks now because we're just watching people at their jobs. But it's always been that. Actor is a job.
"I had a job interview five years ago. So for that guy interviewing me, this is where I saw myself."
It's fun to tell progressive women they look like Caitlyn Jenner because they have to pretend like they're fine with it.
Stop the presses!! It's all digital now.
"It's t-t-t-Tuesday folks!!! Hot newbie here ""Bumble Do."" @JoeListComedy & @marknorm are on a roll with butter!.  . Go!"
"People only say ""that's none of your business"" when it's something scintillating. But really, asking ""what's up?"" is none of my biz either."
"The only group you can make fun of now is kids. I think because we used to be one. You can't say ""I can say that I was Mexican for 18 years"""
My scrotum looks like it smoked for fifty years.
'Mars water' will still be cheaper than Figi water.
Thank god breast milk is easier to quit than smoking.
Everyone gets angry when I give them a fake laugh but no one seems to mind an obviously phony 'haha' text.
I typed 'I'm sorry' into the text message search bar and the results were endless.
You're allowed to announce what foods your picky about but you can't do that with groups.
"Adding ""esque"" is a fancy way of saying 'it's a lot like that other thing.'"
A girl sent me a racy pic then I saw it's also on her Instagram. That's like telling someone juicy gossip then seeing it's headline news.

Dating sites are the only time you look for something online that you have to win over. You don't have to charm the guy at zappos.
Thank god women don't care about looks as much as men do. If they did only like 11 guys would have all the girlfriends.
Heaven sounds so great yet no one seems excited to go.
"""I don't believe my eyes!"" You should really establish a trusting relationship with those."
"I ran into a girl I'm dating's ex boyfriend. He said ""hey, treat her right!"" I was gonna kick her down some stairs but since you say so..."
"When I burp a girl says 'very sexy.' Hey I don't make sarcastic remarks when you do something I find unattractive, like talk about your kid."
Why can't you accept me for who I am? Someone who doesn't like you.
"The thumbs up button on Facebook is a nice way of saying 'Ok, we're done here.'"
"I'm so bad with money. When someone pays me back money they owe me, in my head I think I've made money."
One good way to never end up in a heated political debate is to not care at all.
I saw a tinder photo of a woman carrying a gun and a baby. Not sure which object is scarier.
You never seem to hear about the 'punctuation nazi.'
"The atmosphere is like a bouncer when it comes to evaporating. ""Puddle, you're out. Ocean, you're cool, you can stay."""
How come you never see a tow truck break down?
There's nothing more awkward for a heterosexual man than another guy putting a tie on you.
There's a thin space between my bed and the wall. I would be horrified to see what's down there.
Patriotism has come down to an Instagram pic.
I never thought I'd live in a time where we have so many options that people actually say 'boxing is boring.'
It's amazing how hard it is to make a house & how easy it is to make a baby. But how hard it is to baby-sit and how easy it is to house-sit.

We need to push for equal rights for men and women. I think it's unfair that women can touch male strippers.
How far is PC gonna go? I used the term 'Carbon footprint' and a guy told me that's offensive to people in wheelchairs.
If you don't think minorities have it harder just watch a left handed person use scissors.
"I think the gayest thing you can yell is ""details!!???!!"""
As a kid you take drugs to get CRAZY!  Woohoo! As an adult you take drugs because you're actually crazy.

The 'cool part of town' has changed. It used to be dive bars and strip clubs. Now it's pressed juice and an Apple Store.
"You know you're hanging with the wrong group when you make a joke about how dumb fedoras are and everyone's like ""Wait, why? I own two."""
Everyone seems to assume the future holds great things for them. But the future has bad stuff too.

Is there a scientific term for the phobia of not having enough napkins?
"Because of a joke, I got into some hot water with the gays last night. In other words, they liked my joke and we all got into a jacuzzi."
You rarely hear about the masses that are washed.

The guy who invented the office back massage is the Thomas Edison of creepy guys.
People always say they'd love to get a tattoo but won't do it because they're permanent. Then how come no one ever gets a temporary tattoo?
"Can't pick a song on my iPod but if one of them comes on the radio Im excited. Thats why I dont trust TInder, sometimes it has to be chance."
"""Leave them wanting more"" seems to apply everywhere except sex."

"When I talk to anyone younger than me, they look at me the way I look at a landline when it's ringing. ""Eh, that's probably not important."""
That millisecond when you stub your toe but the pain hasn't kicked in yet. That's when I do my best thinking.
There's nothing less satisfying than when a friend pumps you up for a non juicy secret.
Women seem to care about how everything in their life looks except their men.
A standard brunch for me is spending 49 dollars on a frittata then getting a slice of pizza right after.

Hot digity dog!!! This weekend is gonna be a barn burner! Come on out! (Its times like these when I wish I had fans!)
"If you're willing to do the show ""Naked Dating"" then you might as well do porn. Porn is what you hope the date turns into anyway."

A lot of comedians talk about the difference between men and women. I talk about the difference between men and myself.
I don't think guys named 'Clyde' actually exist.
America treats immigrants like a dad who's protective over his daughter. He'll let you stay if you pass some tests or marry one of his own.

"In action movies you never see the hero step outta the Ferrari, close the door, it not latch all the way and have to do that door butt bump."
"""Be yourself' is good advice if you're not at a job interview, on a date or around your family."
"Robert Deniro bounces from one African American woman to another. He needs a reality show called ""Bob and weave""."
We only associate the word 'brave' with positive things but bad guys are brave too. It takes guts to rob a bank or stalk a lady.
I'm all about gender equality. I think it's unfair that men get paid more & I think it's unfair that women get more boats named after them.
"If you ask someone how their day is and they say ""thanks for asking"" they need new friends."
"Its weird that wanting to look cool in high school makes you have to stand outside of your job for a few minutes, 6 times a day in your 30s."
"If life gives you lemons, celebrate. You're being handed free produce."
You never really hear about machines that aren't well oiled.
I've never walked thru a revolving door flawlessly.
"We're such a progressive generation, I wonder how we'll sound ignorant to our kids. ""Back in my day, gays couldn't reproduce"" (Kids laugh)"
How do I know this girl's madly in love with me? Because she sent me a 'heart' emoji.
When it comes to cats there's no middle ground. People either despise them or they have too many.
Bruce Jenner looks great but is it worth the pay cut?
Who's gonna write a scathing review of the Critic's Choice Awards?
I wonder if people would show Caitlyn Jenner this much support if she didn't look pretty.
"Whenever someone says ""you've changed"" it's always taken as a negative. But I really sucked before."
"If you don't like being the center of  attention, don't order fajitas."

Why is getting beat up by a girl embarrassing for a guy? You can't hit them back. Wouldn't it be worse if you didn't lose the fight?
You know you have a bad personality when you go somewhere and you hope there's no one like you there.
My friend says you should never racially profile people. He also says he'll never give money to a homeless white guy.
Weird how the only generalizing you're allowed to do in this country is about how fat kids are. We're sensitive to every race but not kids.
"In the Middle East porn is illegal yet prostitution isn't. Weird, that's like saying 'it's ok to drink and drive but no watching Cheers!'"
"You look super creepy if you leave the letter 'h' out of 'hmmm' in a text.

""What time did I say my gyno apt was?""

-""Mmmm, gimme a second."""

I've been all over the country and the one thing I see over and over again everywhere I go is my iPhone screen.
"Going to a girls house just to hook up is like that awkward feeling at a buffet where you think ""how long do I have to wait before I start?"""
I have certain friends who when they get drunk they get stuck in their favorite year. Last night was '2001 Tommy'.
At what age do parents give up on movie titles?
The updated 'Irish goodbye': Two dudes fleeing to Ireland to get hitched without telling anyone.
They say all dogs go to heaven but aren't some dogs gay?
"How come in the game CLUE, you can't just kill a guy in the hallway?"
When you're fighting with a girl and she starts crying its the same feeling as when you're about to kill a roach and it starts flying.
"Whenever someone butt dials me, I'm always impressed their ass can nail the passcode."
"Those old jokes about ""A Mexican, a jew and a black guy walk into a bar"" seemed racist back in the day but now I applaud the diversity."
Cheese makes almost every dish better. Even the word 'cheese' literally makes you smile.
It's weird when you meet a boring person nowadays. I just think 'Do you realize what you're up against? We have iPhones now. Step it up.'

Dinner dates are fun because you and the waiter are both pretending to be better people to get something you want from the other person.
"My friend came out of the closet. I had no idea. He said ""Any questions for me now?"" Yes, in all these years how many gay jokes did I make?!"
Somebody told me I'm impatient. It didn't hit home until I realized I always flush the toilet while I'm still peeing.
Women get hit on a lot. A man has to become a celebrity to get as many sexual advances as a regular woman.
"They say men think about sex every 7 seconds. I've never been having sex and 7 seconds in thought 'Hey, I was just thinking about this!"""
"A sign said ""Stay off the tracks, don't be a statistic."" But you're a statistic if you don't get hit too. That sign should say ""Don't die!"""
"I hate when ppl say ""You're so lucky you're skinny."" No I'm not, I exercise."
"I use my iPhone so much, it's weird writing on paper. I keep thinking ""Hello!! Why didn't you correct 'usuajjky' to 'usually' for me!?"""
Relationships are like Murphy beds. You see someone else's & think 'that looks fun.' Then you get one & it's just sad & hard to get out of.
"You ever remember something your parents did and realize 'ohhhh, that was definitely part of my development.'"
Statistics say that religion is dropping in popularity. At this point the only way to get those numbers back up is if Jesus made a sex tape.
There's not many things that make me panic as much as accidentally hitting the 'FaceTime' button.
"Things are so much easier now than they used to be. 15 years ago, you woulda had to rip your phone off the wall to drop it in the toilet."
"A lot of people who attack gay rights eventually come out as gay. Makes you wonder, how many overtly liberal people are actually racist?"
"Just so it sounds better, I tell girls I'm 'half a dozen inches.'"
"Birds are proof that if you can do it yourself, humans will provide you with the bath."
"How come my friend sounds so progressive when he says ""I don't see color""? But I say ""I can't tell Chinese & Koreans apart"" and I'm a dick."
"I don't know if I'd be good in a threesome but if you need a referee, I'm your man!"

"My Asian friend asked me what it's like to be a white guy. I said ""I can't complain, literally."""
I know it seems like a drink way too much but it's more that I take sips during any moment I feel awkward.
Getting a blackout drunk person into a car feels very similar to putting leaves into a garbage bag.
"A gay guy tried to kiss me, I pulled away and someone called me homophobic. But if a woman pulls away from me, I'm just unattractive."
"Sleep is like a beautiful woman. Because if you get too excited about it, it's not gonna happen."
May the fourth meal be with you.
My hipster buddy takes black-smithing & basket weaving classes. That means one day hipsters will be taking 'talking on the phone' classes.
Marriage scares me because you have to live with someone you hate forever and a wife.
Remember before the internet when breaking a wishbone was a form of entertainment?
"Whenever I hear a guy say ""I want a woman who laughs at all my jokes"", that guy is never funny."
They say English is the hardest language to learn and yet all of us here know it. Well done on that everybody.
"You know you're getting older when ""VCR"" gets autocorrected."
"I used to make fun of bald people, now my hair is starting to thin. Is that how it works? Does that mean soon I'll start rollerblading?"
White males are like curse words. There's a lot of good ones but you can't have too many on one tv show.
"I walked in on a bathroom attendant peeing. I handed him a towel and waited for a tip. He acted like I was nuts. I said ""exactly."""
Sometimes a good tweet gets no love then way later people realize it was good. I call those tweets a 'shawshank'.
"""I like where your heads at""

-guy on acid"
"It's smart that religion is free. If you had to pay for it once a month like Direct tv, a lot more people would unsubscribe."
A bulletproof excuse always has a death in it. Whether it's your grandma or your phone.
Fruit is like your first love. You pass it up for something more exciting but as you get older you realize it was the best thing for you.

Gay guys really think outside the box.
"When it comes to athletes, 'Pros and cons' are kinda the same thing."
"I kinda like watching people make out in public. That's why when I see it, I always yell ""Don't get a room!"""
"Because of the obesity problem in America, the news claims that 'fat' is the new 'F' word. Uh, shouldn't we run that by gay people first?"
Hiring illegal immigrants is like bringing your own candy to the movies. Sure it's shady but sometimes you just wanna pay less.
"Your insult still hurts even though you ended it with ""Hey, I'm just being honest!"""
It's weird that people don't like being called 'trashy' but they still act or dress trashy. I don't get stuff like that.
I hate a porn that's based in a gym because then I feel bad for two reasons.
No one should feel embarrassed about meeting people online. That's just how it is now. I met my parents online.

"There's 2 types of people in the world:  The guy who says nothing when you take off a sweater and the guy who yells ""take it off!"""

Don't put a full length mirror in your bathroom. I keep thinking I'm being attacked by a naked guy who also has a birthmark on his penis.
"If Taco Bell is mysteriously closed you'll drive to another one. If the gym is mysteriously closed you say ""Welp, I tried!"""
Bangs are a beard but for the top half of your face.
"It's common courtesy to ask ""how you doing?"" but I hate it. If it's good I feel like I'm bragging, if it's bad I get sad. Lets go with 'hi.'"
"I don't have great gaydar but if I see a guy putting on Chapstick, I always know for sure."
We congratulate people on losing weight. But what about ppl who never gained it? Where's my parade for never getting fat in the first place?
"I saw a girl outside reading a billboard about a tanning place. You know, if you read that sign long enough, you'll get a free tan?"
"It's Thomas Jefferson's birthday today. Someone should make a newsletter about the founding fathers called ""Daddy Issues."""

You used to get a lollipop after the dentist. That's kinda counter productive. After you get liposuction they don't hand you a McFlurry.
Sometimes I'm late just because it makes things a little more interesting.

"I've got a lot of grey hairs coming in. I guess eventually, everything gets gentrified."
"When you think about it, functioning alcoholics are actually harder working than everyone else."
I can't even predict what people are gonna be offended by now! A lady was breastfeeding & a guy got angry because he was lactose intolerant.
"Ironically, hitler would've loved Jswipe."
It must be weird if you have a fear of flying and on a flight you see strangers sleeping during the scariest moment of your life.
The symbol of America would be a lot sadder if it was a 'balding' eagle.
To win over girls you can work out and wear nice clothes but nothing seems as effective as inconsideration.
It kinda defeats the purpose that the only time I eat vegetables is at a Chinese buffet.

A sofa that turns into a bed is like a pick up truck. Your friends get more out of it than you do.

I'd like to see one woman history tell another girl she doesn't like her new haircut.
Tagged on Facebook is the new lipstick on the collar.
I saw a Native American in a cowboy hat. Why wear something worn by a group that oppressed you? You don't see black teens in a cop uniform.

The first guy to head butt someone must've been pretty desperate.
I don't understand the the chain lock on the door. I don't want any intruders to come in but I do want to tease them a little.
Most bald eagles die from eating carcasses on train tracks and are too full to fly away. Definitely the perfect symbol for America.
People tend to be pretty negative except with the word 'luck'. When we say 'he's very lucky' we always assume it's good luck.
DJs do to songs what I do to porn. I speed it up when it's slow and repeat the parts I like.

Nothing takes the heat out of a passionate argument like back-spacing.
"If a girl is scantily dressed, we say she has low self esteem. But if we see a girl all covered up no one ever says ""she's so cocky!"""

Heaven is the only after party that older people want to attend.
Crazy that after all these years Harper Lee comes back to write Magic Mike 2?

"""I brought my own whiskey, I'm a bit of a snob."" No, you're an alcoholic."
"Americans feel uncomfortable saying the word 'black'. Southern food, Baby food, Jewish food, bla.... Soul Food."
You should never call a girl fat cuz women are judged by their looks. Men are judged by their worth yet it's fine to say 'that guy's broke!'
"People treat their sports team like a religion. Although, if you move to another town no one goes ""Ok, I guess I'm Muslim now!"""

The only thing worse than hanging out with a really sad guy is hanging out with a guy in a really great mood.
"A confederate tattoo is a red flag, literally."
"Whenever a guy calls a celeb 'racist' & we find out he isn't, why isn't that guy punished? Less people would do it if you had to apologize."
The thing I hate the most about the winter is not having the self-esteem to move a coat off a chair so I can sit down.
"With all the millions of pet pics out there, makes you wonder if dogs and cats think of their owners as TMZ."
Sign at a porn shop: 'under new mgmt'. If you've ever gone to a porn shop & said 'I wanna speak to the manager' ur watching too much porn.
My girlfriend hates fiction. Which is why I never answer her questions.

Comedy is the only gig I've ever had where I wanted customers to show up.

The worst part about putting on a jean jacket is when you realize you're already wearing jeans.
Kinda surprising that the black market and The Boston Market haven't had any problems yet.
Don't you hate when you throw out a really obscure fun fact and the person you're talking to already knows it?
"For a group that some people consider unnatural, gays are the only group who's flag appears in nature."
"The cool thing about diabetes is, it's the only disease where if they can't find your medicine, the cure becomes cookies!"
It's weird that people get mad at you for telling them the same thing a mirror does.
I dated a girl who wouldn't say 'bye' at the end of a call. I never knew if it was over. So I eventually broke it off but I never told her.
One of the weirdest parts of being a parent must be watching your kids date people with your worst features.
"My friend just said ""I couldn't be a pedophile cuz kids annoy me"". There should be more holding you back from pedophilia than a nuisance."
Anytime a guy has something 'on his person' it's rarely good.

"Whenever I seem poor, I just pretend I'm environmentally friendly. 
""You haven't gotten your car fixed yet?""
""Uh, I'm going green..."""
You ever get annoyed when something good finally happens because it means you can't keep complaining?
"Heard a guy say ""I'm so good with women."" For some reason that's ok if it's about women but imagine someone saying ""I'm great with blacks!"""
The trickiest part about being white is making sure you enjoy the privileges even with all the guilt.
"Women love confident men but confidence comes & goes. It'd be odd to always be confident. 
Doctor: ""You have Ebola""
Me: ""Eh, ain't no thing"""
I know a girl who's really tall and won't date guys under 6'2 no matter how great of a guy he is. Tall couples prove that love isn't real.
Waking up early sucks but it might help if in that saying the early bird got something a little more enticing.
"Big Bang Theory is the #1 show yet I've never met anyone who watches it. Watching it is like being gay in the 30s, you can't admit it."
"I feel like if I keep working really hard, one day, just maybe, I'll have a headboard."
"A guy told me a lame story then said ""you can't make this stuff up!"" Star Wars, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings. Your story is fathomable."
"Say what you will about me but... You know what? Don't say what you will about me, I'm sensitive."
"It's bad when you finish too early in bed but it's even worse when you do it and yell ""oh fiddlesticks!"""
I started taking propecia & my gf said she'd rather me have erections than hair. Thats true now but a bald guy with boner is a bad start.
Hooking up when you're single is like a daily hunt for food. Relationships are like having a fridge full of food but its all leftovers.
You ever zone out and realize you've been putting the hotel remote in your mouth?
"I need some new headshots, I'm gonna go run some red lights."
It's a good thing I can't hear peoples actual reactions to my texts. You get to assume you're getting big laughs.
It's a lonely feeling when no one knows what you're talking about. It's even lonelier when Google doesn't.

"I understand it now but the first time I heard about breast reductions, I remember thinking ""Why???!"""
"An old lady walked in on me naked and said 'nothing I haven't seen before!' Oh man, were my photos leaked?"
"Men are like dangerous drugs. If a woman does a lot of them, she probably had a bad childhood."
I smile when I'm uncomfortable. That doesn't go well when the old guy is naked next to me in the locker room.
I love when a guy is so gay he can't talk without clapping.
"Someone told my friend he looked like a serial killer. Which is ridiculous, he's not even white."
Cats are like whiskey shots. One or two is fine but anymore than that and you may have a problem.
"Men are like houses, if you can speak another language or play the guitar it's like adding a pool to a home. Your attractive value goes up."
I liked you better when I didn't like you.
Where is all the squirrel shit?
"I love when a guy rambles on about something then says ""does that make sense?"" Hmmm, maybe figure it out before it falls out of your mouth."
I don't like going to mass because I don't think Jesus deserves that many standing O's.
"Whenever I get homesick, I just watch COPS and wait for them to arrest someone in my home town."
200 hundred years ago if someone was in bed for 3 days they had pneumonia. Nowadays it means you got Hulu.
"Who's more excited about free food, starving villagers or people who work in an office?"
It must be a relief to be a girl and know you can do or say pretty much anything and never get called a 'fag'.
"Hipsters are confusing because they have new ideas: gay marriage, legal weed but their things are old: rolled cigarettes & record players."
A wedding ring is basically just an adult version of a hickey.
"I love when guys say ""I don't understand women!"" because they're basically saying ""I don't get it, how could she not like me?"""
"The word 'actually' can really make a sentence sound way worse.

I get nervous about having a child because all my plants are wilted and they're fake.
"If I were raised in a barn, I'd really resent all the generalizations."
"If you don't think looks are important, just remember they put make up on corpses."
Telling a girl you like that she's your 'white whale' never goes as planned.
Homophobia is so gay.
"I'd be the worst doctor, I'd treat it like I did waiting tables. ""Another one? This guy looks like a dick. Anyone want my next patient?"""
I never feel judged more than when I'm picking a radio station in a car full of people.
"Out of all the human senses, you're really only allowed to look and listen to strangers. Smelling gets weird and tasting is illegal."
It's interesting that most girls wouldn't be attracted to a guy if he couldn't beat her up.
My cousin told me I have a gambling problem but he just got married. Even I know those are bad odds.
"The game Guitar Hero inspired my friend to learn guitar. Next, they should make a video game about talking to your kids."
"No wonder women get attached more often, we're going inside them. I feel way closer to my proctologist than my chiropractor."
You know your girlfriend wants kids when she starts giving you the down syndrome statistics.
A girl called my friend a creep at a bar last night. Calling a guy at a bar a creep is like calling a guy at a restaurant hungry.
"Why don't we call a beard ""bottom burns""?"
"People always say ""hardcore atheists are just as bad as the super religious cuz they think they know too."" Yeah but one theory is logical."
"I don't like to use the word ""homeless"". I prefer the term ""Perpetual Tailgater""."
All these elevator surveillance videos lately makes me realize that someone has a lot of footage of me farting and giggling alone.

A guy broke his sobriety last night to drink with me. I felt bad but it is flattering. Now I know how gays feel when they turn a straight!
How many times can I look in the fridge before I realize I am at the wrong apartment?
"A lot of cars nowadays have rear view cameras. That sucks cuz I was the stand on the curb, wave you in  ""keep coming back, ok cut it!"" guy."
I think the reason a lot of long distance relationships don't work out is because of how people look when they Skype.
"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, except blackface."
I'm gonna be sad when newspapers go out of print. Mostly because I'll have to line my birdcage with iPads.
A girl told me she loves it when guys call her and not text. I'm the exact opposite. If I see a girl calling me I assume I'm a new dad.

Girls say porn is misleading cuz it makes men think women have no pubic hair. It also misleads women into thinking all men have nice houses.
"Nothing makes me panic more than when they put a couple sentences on the screen during a movie. ""I don't know how much time I have!!'"
Sometimes I say things that are offensive and don't even realize it but I'm not gonna change. I have 'autistic integrity'.

I ate at a very authentic Chinese restaurant yesterday. Some guy tried to bring his two daughters in but the hostess only allowed one.
"Too bad babies aren't like melons, where you can squeeze and sniff them to tell if they're rotten before you take them home."
You know someone is kissing your ass when you text a typo and they still text back 'haha'.
Illegal weapon dealers never talk about how hard it is to find a briefcase with the exact foam fitting for their guns.
"If someone refers to Vietnam as 'Nam', it's never positive."
"Ironically, those 'Keep Calm' shirts are really agitating me."
The Blue Man Group is the only colored people we should be putting an end to.
"The same way camera phones are capturing how awful many cops are, podcasts are capturing how boring many celebs are."
Cops probably sound a lot less cool when they catch a criminal and the police station isn't downtown?
I think it's impossible for a male to see another person doing a push up and not correct them on the form.
"I find it insulting when I come up with something and someone says 'why didn't I think of that?' Hmmm, I can think of a few reasons."
"Don't ever name your kid ""wifi"". If he gets lost and you tell people you're looking for him, people will just give you a password."
I'm sorry but I don't trust an elevator button that doesn't light up.

I like seeing gay a couple with a kid because you know there's no way that kid was an accident.
"If a guy says something racist around you, as awful as it is, you know they trust you. 
-""I hate Mexicans""
-""I didn't know we were so close"""
It's crazy to think that at one point in our lives the word 'skinny' was an insult.
Walk of shame? I was just high-fived by a doorman.
"There's a real problem with diversity in this country, especially amongst serial killers."
'Home made' sounds great when it's about food but not so great when it's about clothes or porn.
"I asked a guy what time it is and he showed me his watch. Going by that logic, I asked him how his wife looks naked."
It's weird when dudes send emojis or as I call them 'homo-glyphics'.
I'm a lot like Rain Man but if you take away the mathematical skills.
"If you ever want some alone time in America, just take the stairs."
I get rejected so much I know what it feels like to have a Diner's Club card.
It's odd that southerners are known for being racist and hospitable.
How come when someone's described as 'dressed to kill' they're never wearing camouflage?
I always get called 'gay' for stuff gay guys would never do. No gay guy has ever been scared to call a girl.
"It's interesting that a booty bump is more acceptable than a hand on an ass. Butt to butt = fun times. 
Hand to butt = harassment."
"It's fun to say the term ""too soon"" at the wrong times. 
Friend: ""My son's graduating from pre-school today.""
Me: ""Dude... too soon."""
It's weird that it's illegal for me to text and drive but it's legal for me to drive a stick shift. I know how to text.
"They say all dogs are color blind but come on, we've all met a racist dog."

I love meeting new people: babies.
"You ever see someone's online profile pic and think, ""that was your best photo?"""
"A guy asked me if I was scared of dying alone. I'm not scared of dying alone, I'm more scared of dying in a group."
"I don't get hating a whole group of people; blacks, gays, Jews. I hate specific things about people; goatees, neck tattoos and goths."
"I remember when the phone was a big block on the table. Makes you wonder, in the future what other big appliance will fit in our pocket."
"If you have sex on a plane you're part of the 'mile high club'. If you have sex on a bus, you're a member of the 'rock bottom troupe'."
I told a woman I wasn't religious and she asked me if I worship the devil. Thats like saying 'you don't like baseball? Mets fan huh?'
"I love when Facebook says ""Bob Jones (friends with Joe Smith) sent you a request."" It's like FB is saying ""Hes not a nut, he knows your pal"""
Working at a bank would suck because I'm broke & I'm just handling rich people's money. That'd be like a virgin working as a gynecologist.

Sick of me yet America? Just be thankful you don't have to live in my head! Watch me tonight at 12 on @ComedyCentral! #TheHalfHour #Jews
You can tell you're actually friends with someone if you go to a bar together and don't cheers.
You ever see yourself in a dumb outfit from 15 years ago and say 'what was I thinking?' That's how people against gay marriage will feel.
"Hey goys, take a gander at my @ComedyCentral special tomorrow at 11. They'll give these things to any white male! !"
"Instead of complaining about 'haters', maybe you should wonder why so many people dislike you."
If religion was a credit card no one would sign up. Terrible restrictions.
My doctor keeps telling me to stop drinking but that's what's keeping him in business. He should be telling me to lay off apples.
"You should treat people the way you want to be treated, unless you're into S&M."
"As a kid, sex scenes make you uncomfortable in front of your parents. As an adult, sex scenes make you angry in front of your wife."
When people complain about a lack of 'diversity' they really just want more of their group.

"I bet if superheroes did exist, they'd be kinda surprised to see what kind of guys are wearing their shirts."
It seems insensitive to call the smallest size of mattress a 'single'. Why don't we go ahead and call futons ''lonelys' or divorcees'?
Normal people are weird.
"Hobos are interesting cuz they're saying ""Im not responsible with my money & look where it got me. Could you be irresponsible & gimme some?"""
"A gay guy said to me ""you'll never know what it's like to be ridiculed for being gay!"" That's not true, I went to theater camp."
"A guy told me ""watch your mouth around the lady!"" Shouldn't that be her call? What's worse, her hearing cursing or you making her decisions?"
I'd be a happier person if I laughed as much in real life as I do in texts.
I know a girl who won't do anything in bed except sex. She's the sexual equivalent of a pizza place that won't serve slices.
My friend wants to buy a boat and that's all he talks about. He's got a mouth like a sailor.
The closest I get to feeling like a dad is when I use a baby wipe to clean off my iPhone. Then I kiss it and say 'who's a clean phone?'
"Ppl will argue with you about anything but racism. ""You don't like pizza!? You're crazy!""
""You don't like Jews? Well, to each his own."""
My album 'Still Got It' on @ComedyCentral records comes out on Tuesday! Get one now before iTunes runs out of them!
I hate when I ask a guy how he did that & he cockily says 'don't worry about it'. That's not an answer & it sounds like you killed someone.
"My girlfriend just told me she hates when I bring up her period. I hear ya honey, why don't we both stop."
"I think about sex and my phone every 7 seconds. Luckily, I'm on a family plan..."
"If you 'consider' someone a friend, they're probably not your friend. You'd never consider someone your wife."
You like something more if you have to work hard for it. That's why guys are more excited about sex.
It's amazing how black people dominate every sport. If white people wanna stand a chance they should make a sport out of tipping.
"I love when people say ""Why would I lie?"" Hmmm, mostly to benefit yourself."

"The best compliment I've ever gotten in bed was ""Go easy tiger, this bed is IKEA""."
"It sucks being ignored by someone, unless that someone has a clipboard."
"If you can throw the word ""ilk"" into a sentence and no one mentions it, you're doing alright."
It's weird that God is good and the devil is bad yet no one is scared of the devil. No one's masturbating worried the devil is watching.
"Apparently, when a woman says she's 'trying to get pregnant', it doesn't mean that moment at Whole Foods."
Booze is the only drug where we act like it's a different thing during day. There's no 'day cracking'.
"Thanks Mom: @lizatSoFAB: My son, @marknorm's  album and the special on Comedy Central."
Someone asked me if I hated Jews. If I did I wouldn't live in New York City. That'd be like hating black people And living in a Red Lobster.
"Am I the only guy who's incredibly embarrassed when I hear anything with man in the title?: ""man-cave"", ""man-scaping"", ""manswers""."
I wish everyone was as hard on themselves as I am on them.
"I wonder if certain bands get pissed about who pops up on their pandora station. ""Phil Collins, really?!"""
My friend has a Chocolate Labrador. Seems weird to name a dog after something that kills them.
"For women, smiling at a guy is like giving your email to a business. They never stop bugging you after."
"I think my pal is gay but he won't admit it. The most he'll say is ""I experimented in college."" But he went to college online... #Gaypride"
"I have the worst gaydar. For me trying to tell if a guy's gay is like trying to tell if a ceiling fan's turning off. ""Which way's he going?"""
"""Hey man, can you stop talking for a sec so I can check my phone!?!"" 

- America"
I only see kids and old people eating graham crackers. For some reason no one between age 10 to 55 is touching a graham.
The only thing worse than being accused of sexual harassment is having to explain to the woman that she's not even attractive.
You rarely see a gay guy slouching.
"This restaurant required a blazer, I didn't have one so they gave me one. Most playgrounds require a kid, I hope it's not the same policy."

"Whenever a guy screws up we say ""hey, he's human."" But humans aren't all bad. That should change to ""hey, HE sucks."" Don't take us all down."
"Women are smart, they made their gender roles offensive. A guy won't change a tire: ""bit of a dandy."" A girl won't cook: ""right on sister!"""
Boxing classes are weird because you're learning something that's illegal to do with somebody outside of class.
Don't compliment a woman's cleavage. It's a trap. It's like when they offer you weed at the park.
The definition of low self esteem is when I pass up the Brita to go for the tap.
"Whenever someone says ""Can I interrupt?"" No one ever says ""nope""."
"Hating Jews is like having a gluten allergy. You have to ask questions at the dinner party. ""Are there Jews in this? They make me sick."""
"Sex and wrestling both get sadder when you go pro. You have to get an angry manager, wear a revealing outfit and get smacked around."
"Every show on TV is just people at their jobs. Pawn shop, fisherman, stylist. The only ppl we used to watch do their job on TV were actors."
It sucks that the people who seem to love America the most are usually our worst representatives.
"My friend is complaining that our waiter is 'phony'. But who wants their waiter to be real? ""What's the soup of the day?""

-""Who cares?"""
I told a guy I went to the gym and he said 'but you're not fat'. Exactly.
"Women always say 'men are pigs, men are dogs, men are scum.' Yet they keep telling me to be a man. Ok, if you insist."
"You know you've arrived when, after a phone call, you hand your phone to someone else who hangs it up for you."
"Is ""hubba hubba"" still a valid means of complimenting a women? It's doing nothing for me on dating sites."
"A guy drives by in a big car, a girl says 'I bet he's tiny'. But when an Asian guy hops out of a Mini Cooper no one says 'bet he's packing'."
"If Clark Kent loses his glasses, everyone would wonder why Superman was at LensCrafters."

Aren't all suits pant suits?
My dad told me I got all my bad genes from my moms side. That's a weird way of telling me I'm Jewish.
Right when I walk into the gym is when I do most of my fake stretching.
"It's odd that whenever a girl says 'I can't tonight, I have a headache'. No guy ever offers her aspirin."
They should do an episode of Intervention for the girl who was hooked on phonics. She'd be really confused.
"Whenever someone asks me 'so, what'd you do today?' I feel like I have to add 6 productive things. I can't just say 'Hulu' right?"
"Whenever I wanna sound smart, I mention 'the cloud' a few times."
"How come whenever someone tells you about who they were in another life, it's never a douche?"
It'd be fun if   made a realistic commercial of what a real first date is like.
Sex is the only thing where you lose respect for someone once they start getting paid for it.
"A Nazi-pedophile needs to start a band so whenever I ask ""what music are you into?"" People will stop answering ""I like everything""."
I know it sounds crazy but I'm pretty sure the stripper last night was into me.
"I'm pretty insecure, if I was gay and getting married, I'd be really nervous about that 'best man'."
In my jokes I make generalizations based on majorities. We all do. We say the sky is blue because it's the majority but sometimes it's grey.
"It's weird that not having healthcare is illegal. 
-""What are you in for? Murder, rape, assault?""
-""I paid a ton of money for anti-biotics"""
It's weird when people say 'no joke' after saying something serious. That's like saying 'no homo' after kissing a girl.
"One of my favorite pastimes is going up to thugged out white guys and whispering to them ""Psst, hey man your pants are falling down."""
In this country you can go to war before you're allowed to drink alcohol. That may be why vets really catch up on booze when they get back.
You get vitamin D from the sun and from whole milk yet there's no two things that  go together worse.
Noise cancelling headphones are great for music but terrible for porn.

My friend always has to remind me what the pig went thru before I eat bacon. Thankfully he doesn't do that with strippers.
A girl asked me where I got the condom and I said 'I got it for free at the bar' and she was grossed out. But that's how I got her.
I saw an ad for a 'family' pack of condoms. Shouldn't that be called a 'no family' pack?

Telling me you almost favorited one of my tweets today is not a compliment.
"My life is just one constant question: ""be myself or be liked?"""
"Calling someone 'fearless' isn't really a compliment. ""That guy just jumped out of an airplane! He's missing an emotion!"""
"Someone at a house party came up to me and said ""We're facebook friends!"" You might as well say ""We're strangers who both have internet!"""
"You shouldn't butter people up, it's gross, weird and takes a lot of butter."
"I wonder if dogs would make some changes if they could give each other tips. ""No need to spin 3 times before sitting, it's pointless."""

The food with the least integrity has gotta be imitation crabmeat.
I'm not sure if joggers are aware of the shame they make hungover people feel.
The term 'strong silent type' is weird because anytime I'm not talking it's because I'm nervous.
No one ever sees Jesus in healthy foods.
"I have to remember when a girl I'm with takes her shirt off not to yell ""best day ever!!!"""
On Facebook they just add me into weird groups without my permission. Thank god that wasn't around in the 40s.
"Don't tell me where prices are starting, tell me where they're ending."
When biting into a sausage people always say 'you don't wanna see how it's made'. You'd never hear the same thing about a baby.
"""If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all"" might be the worst advice of all time."
Sometimes I can't tell if women like men or if women just like when men like them.

Yeeha! Tonight thru Saturday I'll be headlining the @comedyattic! Hot club! Get tickets now because there's a lot of seats left!
White people definitely stole Rock & Roll from black people but you guys started it by stealing the N-word.
"Going to a strip club in Portland just cuz there's so many is a weird reason to go. In NYC my friends aren't like ""let's go watch the Jews!"""
I feel like a real square when I don't know which is the bands name and which is the album title. I really like the band 'Nevermind'.
"When it comes to poles, strippers are the opposite of firemen. When it comes to calendars, they're the same."
One of the saddest things to watch is a fat guy trying to get something out of his pocket when he's sitting down.
I saw a guy with an old rebel flag t-shirt. I know vintage shirts are hip but vintage ideas usually aren't.
I can't stand when people play mind games with me! I do my sudoku alone.
"The chicken is doing well. When you buy eggs, you never have to specify from what animal."
I drink and text during Mario Kart for practice.
"Whenever my friend says ""I'm gonna give it the old college try."" I assume he's gonna get his parents to pay for it."

People say looks aren't everything but there's no Tinder for personalities.
"We only say 'he means well' if a guy screws up. It's never ""that guy started Toys For Tots, he means well."""
"You know how you can tell Asians are a disciplined people? After a meal we serve cake, they serve 3 orange slices."
A snow day is the only thing that's actually 'too cool for school'.
"I could never be the president of a big corporation because it seems like a lot of responsibility, also I think racial slurs are hilarious."
Sometimes I write 'Sent from my iphone' on the bottom of my regular emails just so it seems like I've left my apartment...
"My aunt is sad about menopause. Shouldn't this be a big celebration? ""Marge finally stopped bleeding! Let's drink and burn some tampons!"""
"I spend so much time fake washing my hands, I might as well just start actually washing them."

"Things that make people happy are usually frowned upon: happy meal, happy hour and a happy ending."
"Men want what they can't have, e.g., gay marriage."
"It's funny that when you get a new roommate, the most comforting thing you can tell them is ""don't worry, I'm never home."""
"Even if you're Asian, when you speak Chinese you still sound racist."
I love a girl who doesn't know how hot she is. I hate a girl who doesn't know how ugly she is.
You're the reason I get out of bed in the afternoon.
"Women know men like boobs so they get implants, then get mad when guys stare at them. If I catch a fish with a worm I don't call it a creep."
I just wanna make enough money to where my friends won't be blown away when they see me with a smoothie.
Boxers and prostitutes both get paid to do something most people do for free when drunk.
I flew out of the Bob Hope Airport. I doubt they'll ever name an airport after a comic again. You'll never see 'Katt Williams International'
Racism is similar to Nickelback. It's fun to joke about but I hate seeing it live.
"Check me out on @midnight tonight w/ @nerdist, @saraschaefer1 & @Braunger on @ComedyCentral. Hot show! Let me apologize to the Jews now..."
It seems to me that the best way to lose weight is to be in a movie.
How come it's considered cool to have tears in your jeans but holes in your underwear is a 'red flag'?
If Puerto Ricans can say the N-word then I should be able to say the F-word.  Because I'm as gay as they are black.
Texting and driving is illegal but it should depend on the text. If it's a killer joke or a great dick they should let it slide.

""So why do you wanna work here?""
""Who says I wanna work here?"""
"The only good thing about wetting the bed as a kid, is that you learn how to use a washing machine before all the other kids."
I never need a receipt from a deposit but I'd love one from a hobo. So when another one asks me for money I can show him I already donated.
"It's weird to me that people pay for tanning. ""It's a beautiful day, wanna go to the beach?""

I had two ikea beds break within a year. I don't think they realize it but their real talent is in laundry bags.
The N word is the worst slur you can say and black people embraced it and made it their own. My question is why not embrace the other slurs?

"Remember as a kid, how scary it was to go into your friend's parents room?"

"I just gave the worst excuse ever: ""sorry man, I can't text right now, I'm waiting on another text."""
It's weird how condoms are either free at a bar or really expensive. It's actually a lot like sex.
It really bothers me that I've never made a dog laugh.
Do they put condoms in the back of drugstores so you have more time to think about your decision?
"People watching is a lot like bird watching if you add judgement. No one bird watching has said ""you think that sparrow knows he's gay?"""

My friend claims I have a gambling problem but he just got married. Even I know those are bad odds.
My new Drag Queen character is very shy: Mann Frank
How much mistletoe would it take to acceptably rape someone?
"I told a guy I don't have a TV and he flipped ""Oh, you think you're better than me because you don't watch TV?!"" Can't I just be poor?"
"My druggie friends & my health nut friends have a lot in common. They're up early, they grow their own stuff & both keep pushing it on me."
Smart phones really put an end to thumb twiddling.
"I can't do math but my dad says it's because of math we have bridges, buildings and railroads. Dad, I think by 'math' you mean immigrants."
With all the racial tension and homophobia these days maybe the solution is to go back to just making fun of blondes.
"I don't have health insurance, if I'm sick I go to restaurants & keel over. Someone yells ""Is there a doctor in the house!?"" Free checkup!"
What a crazy coincidence it is that I was born on my birthday.
"A girl once whispered in my ear ""I'm not wearing any underwear."" So what? If you were wearing underwear that wouldn't stop me."
People don't realize how frustrating it is to be white. Our two biggest fears are looking racist and minorities.
"I used to never watch the credits after a movie but in this economy, it's nice to see a long list of people with a job."
"At this point, in a courtroom we could put our right hand on a copy of ""The Hunger Games."""
"For me, female multiple orgasms are like a Tyler Perry movie. I'm aware they exist but I'll probably never see one."
It kinda takes the coolness out of your chain wallet when you've got the CVS club card on the key ring.
"For once, whenever a kid gets addicted to drugs I'd like to hear the parents say ""he had no potential anyway."""
"For the record, just because I have an erection, it doesn't mean I'm happy to see you."

"The Yankees remind me of white people. They're very powerful, have tons of money and a lot of people can't stand them."
You're not allowed to drink & drive yet you need a driver's license to buy booze. That's like showing a pic of a guy you hate to buy a gun.
"I dont like the term 'fake breasts'. The breasts are real, just the stuff inside is fake. Kinda like the bible, the book part is real."
"Why is it bad to treat someone like a piece of meat? Meats the best part. It's worse to treat someone like a piece of tofu. ""Ugh, get away"""
I hate myself after I eat fast food and before too.
"I hate when my girlfriend asks me to buy her tampons. Ladies, I dont think you know how embarrassing it is to not be able to afford tampons?"
"Too bad STDs aren't like chicken pox. ""I'm so glad I picked up herpes when I was six and got it over with."""
You ever walk into a fancy store and the alarm goes off on the way in? That's how I feel when I approach a hot girl. Doomed from the start.
I don't get why guys hate it so much when girls talk about their period. I'd rather hear about a girl's period than her day.
"The hardest part of Alzheimer's disease must be seeing your awful tattoos. ""Can someone tell me what this Asian symbol means?!"""
Crazy that making people is cheaper than making keys.
Cats are like whiskey shots. One or two is fine but anymore than that and you may have a problem.
If you're an 'over-eater' you can't really be anonymous.
"People, the answer is yes, it's always yes. You can curse on a podcast."
Wrestling is the only sport that becomes more embarrassing when you go pro.
My porn name would be 'Luke Warm'
The closest I come to working out is flexing my muscles every time a girl touches my arm.
"20 years ago, you had to get suuuuuuuuper drunk to lose your phone."
"Hey lady, think of it this way. My ass is a toaster and your finger is a fork."
"The term ""no hard feelings"" is a nice thing to hear, unless you're in a sexual situation."

I'm at @CrackersComedy in downtown Indy tonight and all weekend! Come say hi and I'll pretend I'm not uncomfortable!
You think toilets get excited when they get to eat drugs?
"I should read more, but I shit too quick."
"If a guy has a bunch of dirty socks around his apartment, that's gross. If a guy has one dirty sock at his apartment it's waaaay more gross."
Erectile dysfunction is the only health disorder that makes women feel insecure. Arthritis never made a woman feel like she wasn't sexy.
Do you think copy gets along with paste? They just kinda got forced to work together.
"A guy said to me ""you don't have any black friends do you?"" I said ""no, I have no friends. I'm not racist, I'm just unpleasant to be around"""
My friend quit drinking and says its hard to stay sober around ppl who drink. Yes but its hard for me to stay sober around ppl who don't.
"For women, sex is like cake. They enjoy it but feel bad after. For men, sex is like cookies, we feel bad too but still want more."
Some days I can't sleep. Other days I have to wake up early. How come they're never on the same day?
"The word 'riddled' is always used with negative things like disease or fleas. You never hear ""that cake is riddled with sprinkles""."
I find it hard to call anyone who wears a robe to work 'your honor'.
What If everything people referred to as 'gay' was actually gay? Things would be very different.
Keep calm and get some new material.
"Hey man, no need to tell me ""just pretend I'm not here"". I'm way ahead of ya."
"Texting me to ""drive safe"" might be kinda counter productive."
"Ladies, I now understand your frustration when a guy can't get it up, I feel the same way when a porn won't load."
I know I'm a classy guy because if you let me sleep at your house I'll repay you by folding the blanket you let me use.
"I think the saddest thing I've ever read was Skymall, on the ground."
I'm not sure which is more pretentious: mixologist or sandwich artist.

Meeting someone is the worst time to learn their name. I'm worried about my breath & looking at your mole. I'm not gonna remember 'Carl'.
"Weird how when you see a super hot guy, you think 'he's probably gay.' Yet, if you see a super hot lady you think 'she's probably nuts.'"
Is it weird to anyone else that courtrooms have audiences?
"A guy said the south is racist yet has good hospitality. Weird combo. ""Crap, a black guy moved near me, I've gotta make a pound cake!"""
"Getting fired and getting dumped are very similar. But either way, it sounds a lot better if you get laid off."
There's no more greater racial tension in America than when a black family is competing against a white family on Family Feud.
This guy keeps texting while driving. It wouldn't bother me so much but he's Amish. Where'd he get an iPhone?
"Do you think prostitutes get mad when we call slutty girls 'whores'? ""Hey hey, I'm the professional here!"""
"Hey Floridians, tonight's a big one! I'm opening for @MrCraigRobinson at the @UCF arena at 8! There's no show like this at Phoenix Online!"
"Bumper sticker said 'Racism is a disease'. Well apparently, I've gotta send my uncle some flowers."
"I just sat in a wheelchair at the airport and a guy yelled ""Hey, you're not disabled!"" That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me."
New ep of @TuesdayStories is up baby! @JoeListComedy & @marknorm welcome @myqkaplan! GIve it a whirl kids!
"Whenever people make me take my shoes off before entering their house, I always ask 'Do I have to pour out my liquids too?'"
Deaf guys must be furious when they see a guy with ear plugs in.
Woohoo! Tonight & all weekend I'll be headlining @ZaniesComClubs in Chicago! Hurry & buy tickets now because there's only a few seats sold!
"Crazy that laws were created after specific things happened. Like, at one point a law had to be made because someone got a dog high."
People tell me I'm afraid of change. I'm only scared of bad change. If you upped my salary I wouldn't be frightened.
You know when you walk into a store that you're not gonna buy anything & an employee approaches you? That's how I feel about every person.
"Nowadays to be safe, kids trick or treat at shops and businesses. Which is nice because we all know pedophiles don't have jobs."
"This girl in Brooklyn is dressed up as ""Slutty Gluten"". No bars or restaurants are letting her in."

"I never use my oven, I'm a microwave guy all the way. The oven is only good for 3 things: Cookies, cakes and suicide."
"I'm extremely well read, if you only count parking signs."
A lot of people hire someone to write clever things for them to say. I need to hire a guy to let me know what not to say.
"I don't understand people who get angry about early X-mas decorations. ""It's not even December and you're already feeling merry!? WTF!?"""
You never see a hobo with box wine. And yet they are very familiar with both things.
"We all know black is very slimming. But if you have a fat face, please just let it be fat."
If a guy gives you his seat it's very chivalrous but if he doesn't at least you know he doesn't think your old or pregnant.
"After watching a lot of old movies as a kid, I was surprised when I grew up that I didn't see more women fainting."
'Godparents' is an appropriate term because I never see them.
"The penis is all about timing. If someone sees it at one moment, it's passionate. If someone sees it at a different moment, it's assault."
"I want you to like me even if I hate you. It's kinda like how, girls want you to find them sexy even if they don't wanna have sex with you."
Spelling 'assassin' is like spelling 'banana' but a little more fun.
I never drink alone! I'm here with all my Facebook friends.
"I sound like a bigot when people show me pictures of their kids. ""they all look alike to me."""
They say 'everyday is a gift'. I'm wondering if I can return this one.
"How come whenever someone says ""I've just gotta be me"" it's always bad?"
I just walked past a strip club with Halloween decorations. If you wanna scare people at a strip club just put pics of the girl's kids.
You never really hear about an upward spiral.

Whenever I bring up immigration a hardcore American gets mad at me. How come super patriotic people seem to hate freedom of speech the most?
I just landed in a small town and the time difference is killing me. I'm thrown off because it's still 2002 here.
I always feel a little powerful when I misspell something on a check and have to tear it in half.

Don't ever feel bad about canceling plans with me. Chances are I didn't wanna hang out in the first place.
Sex with your ex is like nachos. At first it's exciting then you regret it. But give it a little time and it seems exciting again.
"I call my girlfriend's breasts ""Rosa Parks"" because no matter what I do, they just sit there so proudly."
"The game Guitar Hero inspired my friend to learn guitar. Next, they should make a video game about talking to your kids."
"As a kid, I thought performing mouth to mouth resuscitation on a girl was a legitimate way to hook up."
"Racism is a lot like smoking. It used to be way more popular, it doesn't help anybody but the die hards seem to be sticking with it."
"I get why we dress up at weddings, it's a happy day. But at my funeral I want people looking sad, only pajamas and slippers."
You ever see someone who's a hotter version of you? That's a bummer.

Wrestling is like sex. It's way sadder if you go pro.
Sometimes when I get lonely I turn on the DVD commentary and pretend those are my friends talking during the movie.
It's ridiculous how everyone has a blog now. Blogs are like babies. They're too easy to make and and not everybody deserves one.
All Straight Dogs Go to Heaven #AddaWordRuinaMovie
If a bisexual person is missing we should put of picture of them on a carton of half & half.
"If I can't change a tire and a girl tells me  'I'm not manly', thats cool. But if she burns dinner and I say... never mind."
"I can't make eye contact so people assume I'm not listening. But if I was looking you in the eyes, I'd be too busy panicking to hear a word."
A dildo is literally a gag gift.

"Why is it the more a woman hates men, the more she looks like one?"
Vaginas are like washing machines. They're all pretty similar but some won't get turned on if you don't have money.
"My friend walked into a busy restaurant and said 'it's like a zoo in here!' No, this is chaotic, zoos are actually very organized & relaxed."
"You have to understand that going to happy hour with you after work, for me, is just more work."

Breasts are the only organic food that cost less than fake stuff.
Its weird that pigeons are scared of a plastic owl yet they have no fear about  crapping on a statue of a slave owner?
"Fighting with your girlfriend is worse when you're poor. Because when she throws a plate at you, you're out of plates."
"When it comes to sex, most people worry about STD's. I worry about the eye contact."
Texting while driving is illegal yet there's no law against reading a book while driving. That says a lot about people.
The only thing worse than going to an event is not being invited.
Tagged in a Facebook pic is the new lipstick on the collar.
Alcohol is the only poison that makes me a better dancer.
"A guy on the sidewalk called me gay. I don't take that as an insult. You're basically just saying ""you dress well & possibly work out!"""
"Why is it the more a woman hates men, the more she looks like one?"
Vaginas are like washing machines. They're all pretty similar but some won't get turned on if you don't have money.
"My friend walked into a busy restaurant and said 'it's like a zoo in here!' No, this is chaotic, zoos are actually very organized & relaxed."
"You have to understand that going to happy hour with you after work, for me, is just more work."
I've noticed the word 'hock' is only used when talking about pawned items and loogies.
Hot one in LA tonight folks ! I'm opening for the hilarious @amyschumer at the @wiltern at 7! I may die at the Viper Room!
"I'll tell ya, if my identity got stolen, that would really help me out."
If you run a company you can fire people and never see them again. How great would it be if you could do that with friends and relatives?

"Luckily, we can still use 'stupid' as an insult because all the people in that group don't know they're in it."
"I love a good ball busting but if you insult me and its not funny, I'm not gonna laugh. Im not offended, it just wasn't funny."
"If a girl is scantily dressed, we say she has low self esteem. But if we see a girl all covered up no one ever says ""she's so cocky!"""
"It never seems like that much time has passed till you hear how old your friend's kid is. ""Timmy is 8 now!? I've wasted 8 years!"""
"Yes old man, porn is easier to come by nowadays. But in your day you could drink booze at work and grab the secretary's ass. I'd prefer that"
"Wife: George can I ask you a question?

Zimmerman shoots a kid and still has a gun? If I got a C in high school I lost my video games!
If I have 5 beers in 5 hours does that make me some kind of alcoholic?!!! I'm only asking because I drink more than that...
"Wine is like tapdancing, I can never tell if it's good or bad"
I'm gonna stop congratulating pregnant women. Because who am I to assume they're happy about it?

"My Native American name would be ""Runs From Intimacy"""
Parks are fun cuz they're full of people trying to better their lives and people who've given up. Where else can you see jogging & heroin?

"I have a Peter Pan Complex. It's not that I wanna stay young, I just think if they made a movie about me I'd be played by a woman."
I definitely peaked in high school. That's why I haven't done acid since then.
"For the record, autocorrect is not a Freudian slip. I don't sub consciously    wanna 'duck' you."
My gay friend hates himself so now we don't hang out anymore. I can't be friends with a homophobe.
"I hate summer. Then people always say to me ""but you're from Louisiana, how can you hate the heat?"" I also hate hurricanes and gator bites."
"Waiters, when you stand there and watch me write the tip on the bill, I'm gonna just start drawing a swastika."
It's sad how proud I am of myself when I ask someone something and they say 'good question'.
"If you work hard to get something, you appreciate it more. That's why you never hear parents who adopt kids complain about them."
"If you live with your girlfriend and she buys an energy efficient 10 year light bulb, she's basically telling you to propose."
They're making a batman movie and they cast a movie star? Crazy.
The devil is bad and god is good. Yet I don't know anyone who's scared of the devil.
"I'm gonna get off my high horse now. I don't know what I was thinking, feeding it mushrooms."
You know your girlfriend wants kids when she starts giving you the down syndrome statistics.
"I had sex with a Hostess last night. Specifically, a Twinkie."
Is it the end of the world? Because I just got an email from the post office.
"If I washed my hair as often as I washed my jeans, I'd have dread locks."
I'm not sure when I really became a man. It was either losing my virginity or paying my cellphone bill?
Some people deserve a baby shower because they haven't had a baby.
"If you want to forget about the bad stuff going on in your life and live in the moment. You don't need drugs, just be late for something."
A lot of people don't know that I'm bilingual. I speak English and body.

"If you have a baby in you, we say you're ""with child."" So I say ""sorry I'm so giddy, I'm with whiskey."""
"Kids are the only huge commitment you can have accidentally. A girl never calls and says ""Remember 9 months ago? It's your jet-ski"""
I've never been fired because of my race. Which is nice but it also means I'm actually just incompetent.
"Rappers are the only musicians that can say their name during a song. I've never heard ""Do you believe in love after love!? Cher out son!"""
"I told a friend I was losing my hair & he said ""I hear ya, I'm going grey."" If a shark bit off my leg would you say: ""I feel ya, tan lines!"""
Being dumped in an email hurts more when it's full of typos. I know I wasn't 'their' for you but it's 'T-H-E-R-E'!
"It seems like there's more terrible things going on than normal. I don't think we're worse than before, there's cameras everywhere now."
I'm a big fan of natural baby food. Some people refer to it as boobs.
"Man, life must be amazing if you're not worried about people liking you."
Things were not going well for you if a sex tape helps your career.
I don't know if you can refer to yourself as Macgyver if it's about a homemade bong.
Everyone's so easily offended and PC these days. It's to the point where I'm worried I'll get in trouble for ordering a Negro Modelo.
You can tell how someone's doing by how much toilet paper they have. 7 extra rolls: steady career. Stack of Quiznos napkins: no healthcare.
"Whenever I get a weird text or call, it's a fun reminder that somewhere in the world a girl gave a guy a fake number."
My friend won't admit to being gay. The most he'll say is that he experimented in college. But he went to college online.
Drunk driving is a skill that often goes unrewarded.
"I know guys who never wear a condom but always keep their iPhone in a case. Makes me wonder, which thing do you care more about?"
I have 4 black friends... THAT I KNOW OF!
"Swimming is very good for you, mostly  because underwater is the only place where you can't constantly check your phone."

"""When I find something I like I stick with it"" - alcoholic"
"I'd find Us Weekly a lot more interesting if, instead of celebrities, they let me know which of my exes were pregnant or arrested."
The trick to a lasting marriage is keeping things fresh in the bathroom.
"It's gotten to the point now where, in a girl's profile pic, I'd rather her have a real moustache than a fake one."
They say the best sex is 'hotel sex'. I think the worst kind of masturbation is 'I'm already late for something' masturbation.
You feel bad about checking your phone so much so you try not to. But you did it anyway! This tweet is for those people.
"The phrase: ""I wanna see other people"" is the only time ""see"" means bang. No one says ""Last night was crazy, I saw my wife."""
"My Mom's heart is always in the right place, which is why she's still alive."
There's a mean bum on my block. I keep giving him Canadian coins hoping he'll move there.
"When a religious person or an atheist says ""I'll pray for you"", you get the same results: Neither one of them does it."
I know it sounds crazy but I'm pretty sure the stripper last night was into me.
"People love finding a 20 in their pocket. Why? It's still your money. If you forget your baby in the car and come back ""hey, a new baby!"""
"People always say ""they'd give their left nut"" to do something. Who's accepting these nuts?"
"Ironically, I'd listen to you more if you talked less."
The absolute worst part about having an itchy butt-hole is that it feels good to scratch it.
"For some reason when I'm trying to get cell phone reception, I shush people around me."
I've never gone hunting. The closest I've come is when I'm looking for wifi.
"I like to say fake slang around my black friends. When they say ""I don't know what that means"" I say ""now you know how I feel."""
"People always say 'go with your gut' but if we did, no one would go to work."

"It turns out if a girl drops something and you pick it up, she doesn't automatically sleep with you. Who knew?"
Having a gay kid wouldn't bother me. It'd be like finding a fry in your onion rings. I'm like 'I didn't expect this but I like these too!'
A girl said I wasn't passionate because I didn't push everything off the table and put her on it. But I've got a Mac Book Pro up here!
"My friend claims people are prejudice against him because he's overweight. Most people can't change why they're mistreated, hit a gym!"
Excited to open for @WhitneyCummings at @ComedyGovs on Long Island tonight. 8pm show. Drinks on me!
"My grandma saves plastic forks because she grew up in the depression. I guess that's why I save old porn, I grew up before the internet."
"Whenever I'm telling a friend a story and I can see he's getting bored, I'll throw in something about him just to get him back on board."

I can't leave a comment on Facebook because then the guy I'm avoiding will know I saw his message.
At a costume party last night I hit on a girl dressed as a panda. She was very convincing as a panda because she never wanted to have sex.
Telling someone they're an 'unbelievable actor' sounds like a compliment but it isn't.
"Ladies, stop arguing with me about what I find attractive in a woman. It's like a vegetarian telling me about steak. You've never tried it."
I told a woman I wasn't religious and she asked me if I worship the devil. Thats like saying 'you don't like baseball? Mets fan huh?'
"Where are all the gay rednecks? You never hear a gay guy say ""I only love 3 things! My gun, my truck and dick!"""
"Any girl that's been nice to me, just know I was probably in love with you at some point."
"Gays are the best. They fix neighborhoods, don't make more kids, usually smart & always positive. Too bad it's the one group we can't breed."
I would never pretend to understand what it's like to part with a loved one but I once took a dump without my phone.

Addict: ""that's true."""
"When you think about it, the whole ""whoever smelt it dealt it"" thing is pretty advanced psychology. Well done kids."
"Somewhere in America today, a kid will blow his fingers off while listening to Katy Perry's 'Firework'. What a county!"
I'm sure foreigners feel awkward here a lot but I bet today really takes the cake.
"Guys, if you're gonna call a girl ""sweetheart"", it looks bad if you're under the age of 68."
"If I was going to poison myself, I think the poison I'd go with would be alcohol."
I wonder if there's one woman on Earth who's perfectly content with her body.
"Making friends as a kid was a lot like a gay hook up. You were like ""Is that a HE-MAN shirt? Wanna sleep over?"" That was it!"
"Action movies will be ruined now when the hero tosses an E-cigarette at a gas tank, walks away and there's no explosion behind him."
Energy bars are small but pack a ton of calories. It's kinda like how a small penis can still get you pregnant.
Wouldn't it be terrifying if you found out your dog was secretly writing a book about you this whole time?
"Once a girl dumped me for asking too many questions about her Nuva Ring.  Her: What should we eat tonight?  Me: So, it's in you right now?!"
"Isn't it weird that being 'up for something' and being 'down for something' means the same thing?!"" - Annoying guy/me"
A big difference between black and white people that no one mentions is that black people seem to actually enjoy their families.
"Women always say 'men are pigs, men are dogs, men are scum.' Yet they keep telling me to be a man. Ok, if you insist."
The internet router has now passed the Nintendo as electronic device that needs to be restarted the most.
"Women claim looks aren't that important until you cheat. Then they're all ""IS SHE PRETTIER THAN ME??!!!"""
"From what I can gather, sweating and bleeding are the only things we do 'profusely'."
I'm told I'm not allowed to smile in my passport photo. Is that because we're not supposed to let other countries know how fun it is here?

"Boy, the internet really ruined things for the town cryer."
If a gay couple has a 'shotgun wedding' the republicans are really gonna be torn.
I can tell when something is very fashionable by how silly I feel when I'm wearing it.

"It's crazy that if you live in New York, everyday millions and millions of people are deciding they don't want to sleep with you."
"A lot of people compare kids to STD's. That's ridiculous, people get upset if you get rid of your kids."
"Isn't it weird when you find out your friend plays an instrument? You're like 'wait, you're better than me?'"
They say 'pink is the new black'. But the Pink Panthers sound a lot less intimidating.
I like to whistle at construction workers. Mix things up a little.
If my friend can't find a girl at a bar he goes to a strip club. That's like not catching any fish then going to an aquarium.
I saw a ballet ad that said 'Its poetry in motion.' That sounds awful. The only good part of poetry is that you can walk away from it.
The mouth begins to salivate when it sees something it wants. I never realized how similar it is to the vagina.
"The ""one that got away"" sounds too close to ""what happened with you and Sarah?"" - ""Oh, she escaped."""
"A gay guy just cut me off in traffic! Well, guess who's headed to Chik-Fil-A!"
"I hate talking on the phone. So, no need to ask me ""is this a bad time?"" Yes it is, cuz I'm on the phone."
"Phony is always considered a negative thing. Yet if I meet someone who I hear is phony I'm like ""good, he'll be pleasant."""
"I feel sorry for all single dads, except for God."
"Before iPhones, the jukebox was the original device people stared at when they had no one to talk to at bars."
"Maybe this country wouldn't be as overweight if, when something was easy we said: ""piece of kale""."
It's the Jewish new year!! My resolution is to send more soups back!
"Ladies, you should just make an album on Facebook titled 'swimsuits' and save us all a lot of time."
"Phone booth, drive in movie theaters and female pubes. All things you never see anymore."
"The lobster bib is proof that once you're rich, we'll let anything slide."
"No, I don't want to hear about the specials. 
- Guy who hates hearing about retarded kids."
"It's crazy that if you live in New York, everyday millions and millions of people are deciding they don't want to sleep with you."
"A lot of people compare kids to STD's. That's ridiculous, people get upset if you get rid of your kids."
"My friend is very dyslexic. Ironically, the only time I can understand his text messages is when he's drunk."
Laughing is contagious but thankfully it's not transferred sexually.
People with alzheimer's must be freaking out today.
"Oh crap, I forgot."
"Somebody stole my phone last night. Man, you've gotta be doing pretty badly to steal a landline."
If you tell someone 'you hate kids' they think you're a monster. So now I say 'I'm the opposite of a pedophile.'
All these political events on tv lately are the worst kind of adult entertainment.
Is it ok to be white after Labor day?
My girlfriend claims to be anemic but I've never even seen her puke.
You can tell its not a cheap greeting card if you turn it over and see a hallmark sign. It's the exact opposites with tramp stamps.
I'd be doing a lot better if people would  stop giving away my product for free! - Prostitute
My body's like a hand gun. I'm not comfortable with it.
My friend said he wishes he was an iphone so he could charge himself. But then he'd probably die from playing with himself for too long.
A lot of girls stuff their bra. I stuff my condom. So far pennies and crayons have worked the best.
I love living in a gay neighborhood. It's nothing but hip restaurants and compliments.
I always make sure to put the flavorful side of the Doritos face down on my tongue.
I'm getting sick of seeing what all my exes are up to online. So I'm gonna lay off internet porn for a while.
Money doesn't grow on trees but apples and oranges do and I don't have any of those either.
"Saw a poster: ""Millions of hungry people don't know where their next meal is coming from."" Me neither! Look at all these take out menus!!"
On the final episode of Jersey Shore they better not say that it was all a dream.

When my gf has a problem she wants me to listen to it but not fix it. So why not just put the rant on itunes?
"When I see a white guy being racist I say ""what is this the1950s?"" When I see a black guy being racist I say ""what is this the 2860s?"""
How come it's ok for guys to wear their girlfriend's jeans but everybody flies off the handle when I walk around with a strap on?
"""Stop having sex"" - the easiest thing on my to do list."
I just had a futon pop up over my head. I must've had a good ikea.
My friend always sends me emails with tons of typos. His defense is he's dyslexic. Does dyslexia make you unable to see red squiggly lines?
"Dude, just because a girl shoots you down doesn't make her a lesbian. But the tool-belt is a dead giveaway."
"This guy refused to shake hands with a gay man, saying 'ya know how many dicks are on that hand?' But he shook mine, is he ok with my dick?"
Nobody likes a racist yet everyone loves their grandpa.
"They say English is the hardest language and yet all of us here know it. So, Well done on that everybody."
"My life is just one constant question: ""be myself or be liked?"""
I can tell my gay friend is bummed out when his emails only end in 3 exclamation points.
I listen to so many podcasts that I'm starting to forget that I need to respond to people that are talking to me.
Wearing your shirt in the pool is not nearly as embarrassing as wearing no shirt while playing pool.
My girlfriend hates my old car I'm fixing. She hates my crummy house I'm remodeling. The only fixer upper girls like are guys.
"People always call my vegan friend 'gay'. I'm gonna switch it. ""See those two guys shopping? I bet they're vegan."""
I'm opening for the very thin @amyschumer tonight and tomorrow at Hartford Funny Bone! Come on out kids!
"Whenever I hit on a girl and we end up having sex. During sex she's always like ""this is great!"" and I'm like ""I tried to tell you!!"""
The black kids always insulted my tight jeans and thick glasses in 8th grade. I wish I had a time machine to show them I was their future.

"""Approximately"" is a really fancy way of saying 'not accurate'."
Getting a black belt in karate is a good example of someone being productive and still wasting time.
Hitting on girls is scary. That's why I only hit on lesbians because there's nothing to lose.
Hot show last night with @RealGilbert at @CarolinesonBway! Thanks for the stories!!
"My girlfriend does stuff in bed I've only seen on the internet. She stands there holding up a sign that says ""Enlarge your penis?"""
Imagine how much less credibility Jesus Christ would have if in every painting of him he had sunglasses and a cocktail.
"Yelling ""take it off!"" is a lot less sexy while someone's removing a band-aid."
I like baseball but not not Yankee fans. The same way I like white people but not white supremacists.
How come whenever I'm talking to 2 people and one walks away I completely shut down?
"I bet the worst part of being fat is when a plane's running out of fuel & the pilot says ""we've gotta drop weight!"" & everyone looks at you."
"I wonder if prostitutes consider ""Pretty Woman"" to be their ""Rudy""."
"""They took the Ni**er out?!"" - Mark Twain"
"I'm bad with money. Whenever I put the bill on my credit card and my friends give me cash, I somehow think I made money."
"My friend claims he likes Indian girls cuz he ate curry as a kid. That's ridiculous. I ate baby food as a kid, I'm not a pedophile."
"For once, whenever a kid gets addicted to drugs I'd like to hear the parents ""he had no potential anyway."""
"When I was a janitor another janitor would always ask ""what are you gonna do if comedy doesn't work out?"" I'd say ""Then I'll just be you."""
"When I lose my erection I call it ""logging off"""
Whenever I insult a group of people someone always says 'it's part of their culture.' Yes but it's part of this culture to make fun of them.
There seemed to be a lot of ramblin' in the 70's. No one seems to ramble these days.
I've got a nasty habit of leaving my house at the time I'm supposed to be there.

I just overheard this guy say 'I can't stand these N-words.' You'd think one of the perks of being racist is that you don't have to be PC.
Whenever I'm hungover someone always says 'alcohol is poison'.  Yeah but it's a really weak poison that makes things more fun.
"When I see a stripper I have the same thought as when I see a fire alarm. ""I really wanna pull that down but then I'll have to leave."""
Shortening Jewish to Jew can sound a little offensive but shortening Gentile to Gents is alright in my book!
"The Olympics are like foreplay, I secretly want it to end."
I learned everything I know about sex from watching porn. I'm pretty good on everything except how to kiss.
Fuck Arby's!!! (I'm just trying to mix things up a little)
"If you want to last longer in bed don't think of baseball, think of the WNBA."
No one likes looking at pictures that they're not in. That's why I don't go to museums.
When you're fighting with a girl and she starts crying its the same feeling as when you're about to kill a roach and it starts flying.
I pulled a thorn out of Snoop Lion's paw and he gave me a bag of weed.
Wasn't Snoop Lion a character on Thundercats?
My friend claims she can use the N-word because she only sleeps with black guys. Then by that logic I'm allowed to call girls sluts.
What's so cool about John Hancock? So he had a big signature? He's just the guy who hogs way too much page when signing your yearbook.
Most guys think of baseball in bed. I prefer to think of soccer because I rarely ever score.
Me and the girlfriend like to role-play. She plays the cop and I play the guy who can't get an erection.
Don't you hate when someone accuses you of being passive aggressive and you're clearly being aggressive?
"I saw a guy on the bus with a tattoo of a cross with flames around it that said ""only god can judge me."" ...That's not true."
"I just saw a prostitute sobbing on the corner. Typical woman, always crying at work."
I'm confused. Why does every care so much that @kristenstewart cheated on Eddie Munster?

I've gotta stop giving bigger guys advice. Great pic by @philprovencio. Check out his blog.
"Randomly, my girlfriend will ask me if I still like her. It's like when gmail randomly asks you to re-enter your password. They need proof."
I'm excited to open for the fun lovin @joelmchale tonight at @CarolinesonBway. Come out at 8 and watch us have a handsome-off.
We all know what happens when you drop the soap in a prison shower. Then don't you think it's about time we got some body wash in there?
In the park this black man is yelling about how stereotypes aren't true. Then I guess it's safe to assume he has a small penis.
I have lemon and orange flavored vitamins. Why don't I just eat fruit?
"You should drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. Especially, if you're trying to pass a drug test."
The people who sell printer ink and the people who sell razors must sit around in leather chairs with brandy snifters and just laugh all day
"It'd be nice if families were always as positive as they were on Family Feud. ""Dad, I wanna be a comedian."" 
-""Good answer, son."""
They say laughing is the work out for your abs. So if I was a personal trainer I'd just have my clients watch porn bloopers.
Everyone says black people are so homophobic yet whenever I go to Harlem there are plenty of handsome guys staring me down.
I think in this country we should separate church and conversation.
"""Student"" is just a fancy way of saying ""unemployed""."
There's a surprising amount of boy scouts at this Chik-Fik-A.
I like to get a box set & watch a whole series in a day. I wish you could do that with relationships. I woulda known Karen cheats at the end
My girlfriend got caught masturbating when I asked her about her day.
Today is my cheat day so I'm headed to the candy store to meet a hooker.
"At least, whoever had the seat next to Fred Willard got the armrest."
The jokes on them because when I was in college I used to steal ketchup from Chik-Fil-A and give it to poor gay children.

Girls like passion. Like when a guy pushes everything off a desk and throws her on it. I get that but I've gotta Mac Book Pro on here...
"Whenever someone says ""it was right out of a movie"" I always hope they're not talking about Philadelphia."
I'm the opposite of a pedophile. I'm not religious.
"Someone at a house party came up to me and said ""We're facebook friends!"" You might as well say ""We're strangers who both have internet!"""
"If I do something great for my town, don't give me a key to the city. Give me a pass that says I can park anywhere."
"You can tell the economy's bad because you never hear anyone say ""You're money's no good here"" anymore."
A good calorie burner: Being in an elevator with a moth.
"When I was a kid and my Mom would say ""stop making that face or it'll get stuck that way"", is that what happened to Sarah Jessica Parker?"
You know you're getting to into porn when you make popcorn first.
"Some women like a nice guy and some women like jerks. So I do both. Every time I open the door for a lady I say ""After you, fatty."""

Just because someone is offended doesn't mean they're right.
They should make Tosh the new go to bad guy in every Lifetime movie.
How bout we crack down on rapists not comedians?
You should see me naked! RT @rachelisawesome: how did I just start following you? You are hilarious.
"Isn't it crazy that everybody gets horny? I mean everybody! Women, teachers, parents, chinese people. Crazy!"

In Midnight Cowboy he met woman by asking where the Empire State Building was. I screwed it up cuz I asked where the twin towers were.
My Aunt got me a candlestick for my birthday last year. So I killed her in the study.
You can tell I grew up in the 90s because I still look under the cap of every drink I buy.
Pedophiles are probably the only people that can tolerate it when their girlfriend does baby talk.
I like to cat call ugly women just to boost their confidence/confuse them.
How come no one becomes a born again Christian after something good happens?
I will now participate in unfollowing Todd Barry
"Sure our economy is in shambles these days but at least no one says ""BOOYA!"" anymore."
You know who must hate instagram'd pics of food more than me? Starving people.
"I just dropped my phone in the toilet then pulled it out. It was an empty one at Home Depot but unfortunately, I'd already peed in it."
"The first guy to ever bite into a lemon and say ""we could do things with this."" That guy was open minded."
I know Hell's Angels are tough guys but do they realize they're one zipper away from being the gay guy from the village people?
My girlfriend kicked me outta bed and made me sleep on the couch last night. Then she got really angry cuz our bed turns into our couch.

People tell you to try really hard and never give up on what you want. That's true for everything except trying to be friends with someone.

I have an ear infection in my left ear. Is that the ear that means your gay? I can never remember.
"Instagram is down!? Boy, these dick pics are gonna look a lot less whimsical..."
I don’t practice safe sex. I have safe sex. Practicing safe sex is putting a condom on a banana.
I'm glad black people beat cigarettes in the restaurant game. They both used to have their own sections but now only cigarettes are banned.

I can't promise I won't break the law. I can't promise I won't hurt somebody. But I can promise you that I'll never tuck in my t-shirt.
My brother told me Pluto is actually a dwarf planet. I think they prefer to be called 'little planets.'
"A lot of athletes prep for big games by not having sex. If that works, In high school I should have been MPV for the Chargers."
I try to be environmentally friendly but every  now and then I like to treat myself and use a ton of paper towels!
"If you're pushing your sober friend to do drugs for your own amusement, you're not that good of a friend - my boring sober friend to me."
"Be careful, Gateway computers lead to harder to computers."
"I love when a commercial says ""These are real people not actors."" Good point Proactiv, actors definitely aren't real people."
What do you think is the smartest thing someone has said while cutting the sleeves off their shirt?
"Just heard a guy say ""my wife does anal cuz shes a trooper."" Wow, thats what my dad used to call me if I went to the dentist without crying."
Never go to the grocery store when you're hungry. And never go to a brothel when you're hungry.
I just wanna have an apartment big enough that I can leisurely put a big puzzle together.
I know I'm living a more full life when I miss a few podcasts.
"If you're in New Orleans come down to the Howlin Wolf! Hot show at 9:30 with some funny Jews! It's good to be homo, I mean home."
"Just for my self esteem, one day I'd like to get a spam email asking ""Do you want a smaller penis?"""
I live in Manhattans lower east side. It's tough yet stylish. There are sneakers hanging on all the wires and they're all cooler than mine.
You know when someone gives you a gift and you don't get them anything? You feel awful. That's how I feel every time I sleep with a woman.
"For the record, just because I have an erection doesn't mean I'm happy to see you."
I hear Lollapalooza has a cardboard cut out of Easy E!

People with chronic diarrhea and nymphomaniacs - People who hate the button fly the most.
I'm wearing flip-flops today because the weather is nice and I don't want men to respect me.
I hooked up with a girl from a Renaissance fair. She's staying in character and not answering my texts. #wench
Dead beat dads are terrible people but they do make it easier for guys like me to meet women.
"You never hear actual criminals refer to their associates as ""partners in crime."""
"""God hates fags"" 
Huh, I didn't know god was in a fraternity."
"If calling a guy a pimp is a compliment, then why is calling a girl a whore still an insult?"
"I know no one likes it when a white guy complains but I think we can finally all agree that the phrase ""Kill Whitey"" was a little harsh."
Come on people gay weddings could save this economy!
"After Betty White dies, I call all of her followers?"
Times have really changed. People used to be bed ridden because of Polio or Gangrene. Now they're bed ridden because of Netflix Streaming.
"When someone is half black/half white we call them ""mixed."" If we've learned anything from Soft Serve, they should be called 'swirled."""
"You know, if you take an Instagram of an old photo you get Polio?"
"Ladies, I know we harass, sexually assault, grope, roofie, fondle and occasionally rape you. But remember, it's just cuz we're fans."
The only bad part of having sex is the fact that I'm there too. If there was only some way to have sex with a women and not be there.
"Wow, Facebook bought Instagram? Man, I'm gonna make an app that makes music sound really shitty and wait for itunes to call!"
"They say ""what you do when no one's looking is what defines you."" So that means I'm mostly defined by laughing at old Frasier episodes."
"Everyone has a blog now. Blogs are like babies, they're too easy to make and not everybody deserves one."
"Boy, when you walk around Vegas and see what all these gals are wearing you can't help but feel for the fathers."

"I just did the easter family phone call. I talked to Mom, dad, aunt, uncle, Nana, cousins. I got passed around like a bowl of dinner rolls!"
Tonight and all weekend I'm opening for the fun lovin' @amyschumer at the Starline Theater in Vegas! This hotel has its own channel!!
I always forget how many comedians I'm following until a Jewish holiday.
You never see a diploma and jean shorts in the same room...
The closest I ever came to being with a hermaphrodite was whenever I use my VCR/DVD player.
"These holocaust photos are really hard to look at but on the bright side, they all look like Instagrams."
"Hey everybody, apples and oranges aren't that different."
White people seem to be scared of two things: looking racist and minorities. It's very frustrating.
"I saw a skinhead on the train with a swastika tattoo on his neck. He was reading Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People."""
I saw a bumper sticker that said 'racism is a disease.' really? I've never thought 'your dads racist? I've gotta send him some flowers.'
Why don't I like driving? Because I don't like doing things where if I stop concentrating for 5 secs I'll owe someone tons of money or die.
Elephants are covered in ball skin.
I told a woman I wasn't religious and then she asked me if I worship the devil. Thats like saying 'you don't like baseball? Mets fan huh?'
Adoption is all baby and no baby making. That is a terrible deal.
"The Black Panthers are lucky they didn't go with ""Black Cougars'. Because that cause me some real website confusion."
"""White people love Craisins!!!!"" - High energy black comedian that nailed it."
If anyone out there needs a best man at their wedding hit me up.
I'm at @GothamComedy tonight at 8 and 10! Mention my name and you'll get treated poorly.
If blacks and latinos can't wear hoodies anymore then neither will I! Because if they don't wear 'em then theyre probably not cool anymore.

Who do you think gets more excited about a free meal? Starving families in a 3rd world country or the staff at any office?
With all the racial tension and homophobia these days maybe the solution is to go back to just making fun of blondes.
It's way easier to function as an alcoholic than hungover.
Girls say porn is misleading cuz it makes men think women have no pubic hair. It also misleads women in thinking all men have nice houses.
"When I guy says his wife is his best friend it makes me uncomfortable. When a gay guy says his partner is his best friend, I get jealous."
After you've been dating a girl for years her boobs become like Times Square. Once you live there a while you just stop going.
"""That's not a knife. Now this is a knife!"" - My Dad, every time he holds a knife."
"I never say fake breasts. They're real just the stuff inside is fake. Kinda like the bible, the cover is real just the stuff inside is fake."
Pedophile excuse: I didn't know! I was taught to never ask a women her age!
"I'm gonna mix things up today by wearing my favorite button: ""Hate me, I'm Polish"""
"If you want me to make eye contact with you, I can't listen to you. Because if I'm looking you in the eyes thats all I can think about."
"Whenever someone says ""We'll laugh about this when we're 50!"" I think man, middle age is gonna suck."
"DJs aren't cool. They get paid to do what nerds do every weekend. Put on a wacky outfit, bring a laptop to a party and not talk to anyone."
Which is worse? Being an unfunny Jewish guy or a black guy that's not cool?
"""But why can't I wish for more wishes?""     -kid in Make-A-Wish Foundation."
"As a kid, if you have an accident it means you peed your pants. As an adult, if you have an accident it means you have a kid."
"Jewish is the only religion you can use as an adjective. ""He's kinda Jewy."" You can't say ""Bob won't let his wife drive, he's kinda Muzzy."""
"Thanks so much sister! RT: @LaurenVino You really killed it at John Oliver! I was so happy I got to see it. Amazing work, dude."
In this porn a guy just farted! This is for immature audiences only!

I'm taping my set tonight and I hear theres free food in the greenroom! Things are looking up since Lounge Lizards! #JohnOliverNYStandUpShow
"If you're single, meeting a gal is like hunting for food. If you're in a relationship its like having a full fridge but its all leftovers."
I bet if you slept with Harriet Tubman she would sneak out in the morning.
"Being an adult is hard. As a kid it was ""I'll give you $10 to jug this hot sauce."" As an adult it's ""I'll give you $10,000 to kill my wife."""
"When me and the girlfriend cuddle she says ""I like when you make me feel small."" So I told her she was insignificant."
What do baseball players think about to last longer in bed? Sex?
"You ever get a text you don't know how to respond to? I just got: ""I'm quitting dairy."" Uh... ok, I'll alert the cows?"
"I finally shaved my pubes today. That was was way overdue, now I can finally see my feet!"
Women are soooooo confusing! They say they like sex but when I try to have sex with them they just run away screaming!! Come on!
"I was scared about my AIDs test and my friend told me that AIDs is no big deal now, it's totally fine. Wow I had no idea my friend had AIDs."
"""we are gonna eat like kings tonight!"" = Chipotle with guac."
"Some gals like a nice guy, some like a mean guy. So I just combine the two. I always open the door for women and say ""after you, fatty."""
"HPV is the human version of the ""Check Engine"" light in a car. When you first notice it you panic then you're like ""I can live with this."""
Isn't every breed a dying breed?
"Why pay for sky diving when you can get thrills for free? Ever yell the N-word at a basketball game? Me neither, but I bet it's a rush!"
My relationship with my mom has never changed. She doesn't see me for 9 months then when I do show up I'm crying and my dad is filming it.
When someone tells you what they don't like about you it hurts but you wanna hear it so bad! What a rush!
Woman's History Month is like that time of the month of the year.
It's crazy to think that guys like George Clooney and Brad Pitt still have to worry about making a woman orgasm.

What can I do to speed up this miscarriage? - Snooki's baby
It's sad that carrots are actually better than carrot cake. The cake should always win.  That's the sign of a failed cake.
The interesting thing about country music is  you rarely get to see a millionaire in a jean jacket.

"It's so confusing buying a new vacuum cleaner. ""Does this one suck?"" ""Yeah, this one really sucks!"""
I can't dance at all. Me dancing is what Red Lobster is to lobster. It's really bad and black people seem to really enjoy it.
They say porn numbs your stimuli. Which explains why I've been bringing a book to strip clubs.
"A girl once whispered in my ear ""I'm not wearing any underwear."" So what? If you were wearing underwear that wouldn't stop me."
"My friend told me he's never had sex without a condom. Wow, that's like seeing a 3D movie without the glasses."
I don't need to be super famous. I just wanna be somewhere around Fran Drescher famous. That's all I ask.
"An overweight cop just nudged me with his nightstick and said ""keep movin."" Are these really our finest?"

Is it considered drinking alone if you're on the phone?
I need to make some real friends. These podcasts will never drive me to the airport.
Guess what! I went to the grocery store when I was hungry and it was fine.
My computer died last night. It was really hard flushing it down the toilet.
I should just stop saying hi to bus drivers... It never goes well.
"I've noticed my Asian, Black and Hispanic friends actually enjoy doing things with their family. As a whitey, I just cant understand that."

Do you think nazis played duck duck goose step?

"Man, can you imagine how shitty other foods feel around bacon?"
"Ironically, JC Penney's women's clothes are kinda dike-y."
I wonder if King Kong felt like he beat the system by not paying the $18.95 to get to the 'Observation Deck' of the Empire State Building.
I've been told I lie a lot. So I've started to always tell the truth and I've noticed that when you're honest life is way worse.
Maybe we're the weird ones. It's possible they're normal and we're all just BIG  midgets.

Smell is the strongest sense tied to memory. Thats why when I walk past an incense place it reminds me of the last time I wasted money.

Tonight's gonna be a doozy! If you're in Philly come on out baby! I'm headlining with a bunch of great comics! 8:30pm!
"Hey dude, if you're gonna have a ponytail don't also have a hot girl ass! Cuz that is really frustrating."
Does it mean I'm paranoid if I think braille is just making fun of us non-blinds?
You're so immature! - string talking to silly string.
Paul McCartney is kind of a MILF!
I've noticed when I describe a distance as a 'stone throw away.' That's about how far away people get from me.
"Man, can you imagine how shitty other foods feel around bacon?"
"Ironically, JC Penney's women's clothes are kinda dike-y."
I wonder if King Kong felt like he beat the system by not paying the $18.95 to get to the 'Observation Deck' of the Empire State Building.
I've been told I lie a lot. So I've started to always tell the truth and I've noticed that when you're honest life is way worse.
Maybe we're the weird ones. It's possible they're normal and we're all just BIG  midgets.
You never see men bragging about how they can probably beat up most women. That's very mature of us.
"I want people at my funeral to be incredibly sad. Just to make sure, I'm gonna have my funeral at the Holocaust museum."
"The hipsters on this train are wearing vests, furs, scarves and old glasses. They look like 5 year olds that got into a trunk in my attic."
With all the terrible things going on in the world we should all be glad that no one is quoting Austin Powers anymore.

I heard 2 drag queens talking about it being 'that time of the month.' I guess for a drag queen that's when they have to call their father.
My friend likes women but said if a guy was hot enough he would sleep with him. So I guess he's impulse-bi.

My landlord is a blind Hatian lady in a wheelchair. She asked if I eat meat. I said yes. She said: Thats the difference between you and me.
Imagining what your funeral would be like was the original googling your self.
My friend is a sex addict and says his sponsor at the meetings is super sexy. Thats a bad idea. Thats like an AA meting with rum cake.
I'm dating this new girl! I cant keep my hands off her. She's upset though because she doesn't know we're dating.
Coconut water is like Purell for the inside.

"The way it felt when a hot girl would sleep with me is now how I feel when a famous person friends me on FB. ""Fine, just stop asking!"""
My friend just got outta rehab. He was addicted to saying he had an addictive personality.
"Something you never hear anymore: ""I met my wife on a line"""
"Woman don't really compliment men. Ladies always say 'men aren't what they used to be'. Yeah, because you never told us you liked that."
"Man, thank god we don't have to have a mini funeral every time our phone dies."
"People are so hard on internet porn. I disagree. Because when I die I won't have a bunch of VHSs for my kids to find, just web history. DAD!"
I cant get into it when my girlfriend wears a t-shirt during sex. Not because shes covering up but because its with a shiny Ed Hardy tiger.
A 'Kodiak Moment' - That's when you get attacked by a bear and someone gets a picture of it.
The way I feel when I watch ROOTS must be the same way black people feel when they watch Tyler Perry movies. Just pure sorrow. #MLK
It'd be nice if hiccups and AIDS had the same cure. Because once you heard you had AIDS you'd get scared and then you'd be cured.
"Im a college grad, a working comic, and have a great girlfriend but nothing makes me feel more accomplished than when I refill the ice tray."
"""I have a wet dream"" - teenage Martin Luther King Jr."
I wouldn't say I have a small penis but if I saw my penis in a porn I'd be kinda disappointed.
Its weird that guys call horny women 'freaks'. Horny women are awesome. A freak is what you call someone with a tail.
"People give a lot of money to charity. Do they ever meet the goal? Will a charity eventually say ""Great, that was enough. It's fixed."""
How come the person who's offended is usually considered right? Just because you're crying doesn't mean you're correct.
"Shoot up a high school and have sex with a relative. These are things I know I'll never do, because I made them my new years resolutions."

"Are we still all pretending Queen Latifah isn't overweight? Ok, just checking."
When hardcore thugs send letters do they call it Gmail?
Men are like hard drugs. When someone does a lot of them it probably means they had a bad childhood.
I'm opening for one of the good ones tonight and all weekend - @amyschumer at @CarolinesonBway. Come on out if you like fun!
When I was a kid I knew I wasn't racist cuz all my imaginary friends were black.
"At bars I always feel like a used penis salesman. Cuz after my pitch I always hear: ""I was looking something roomier or a different color."""
"When you say someone is ""dressed to kill"" they should always be wearing camouflage."
I just got a taste of my own medicine. Luckily it's medical marijuana.
"""I'm here to make friends."" - loneliest reality tv star."
They should make Sarah Palin the next host of Family Feud because she's washed up and she'd kill herself.
Follow Friday sounds like a stalker's cheat day.
I wonder if dentists get jealous when they find their wifes vibrating toothbrush.
The way I feel in sunglasses is the way a bald guy must feel in a convertible.

Sometimes a girls job can make her hotter like librarian or masseuse. But sometimes her job makes her less hot like lawyer or improviser.
"Have they come out with a pandora for porn yet? Porndora! If you like fisting, you'll love..."
"Ppl always try to prove theyre not racist by saying they have a black friend, that just sounds like you are racist but found one you like."
It's creepy if you love Jesus Christ but it's even creepier if you like him.
I don't know my own strength. And by strength I mean my biological father.
Come out to @CarolinesonBway this Fri and Sat at 8 & 10. I'm hosting for the hilarious and handsome @natashaleggero. See you jews there!
Life moves pretty fast. One minute you're banging cheerleaders then before you know it you realize that was a porn you saw earlier.

A 'wine enthusiast' is a nice term for a drunk. Can you also be a 'heroine fanatic' or a 'crack buff'?
The term 'Neo Nazi' makes them sound so modern. Like a nazi with an anti-semitic app on his iphone or a nazi with Mein Kampf on a kindle.

My gf said she needs love the way I need sex. So does that mean she watches 30 seconds of a romantic comedy 3 times a day?
A friend said 'getting laid when single is like a daily hunt for food.' But having a gf is like a fridge full of food but its all leftovers.

My gf said she needs love the way I need sex. So does that mean she watches 30 seconds of a romantic comedy 3 times a day?
A friend said 'getting laid when single is like a daily hunt for food.' But having a gf is like a fridge full of food but its all leftovers.

"The word ""Accident"" is the N-word for babies."
People always say kids are cruel. I think adults are worse. I'd way rather be called doody-head by a 9 year old than anything by my booky.
Saying you have black friends doesn't prove you're not racist. Just cuz you're friends with someone doesn't mean you don't hate them.
"I just heard that women can have three different kinds of orgasms. Wow, who knew women had orgasms?"

Thank god sex spam is only online. That'd suck if a girl said she'd bang you then when you touched her she tried to sell you an ipad 2.
You know that feeling when someone you dont know sees your messy apartment? That must be how people who live in chinatown feel all the time.
Someone told me that I'm not good at being an adult. How can you be bad at being over 21?
Who cares if this presidential candidate is harassing women? Don't you guys remember Groper Cleveland?

They say heroine is better than sex. But which kinda sex are they talking about? Male or female?
Why are you allowed to get mad at me if I don't think you're funny? What did I do?
Has it been long enough where I can just take pumpkins off people's porches and eat them?
I wish I had a time machine so I could go back in time and not watch this Back to the Future marathon.
I'm starving at my friends house and all he has is wax fruit! This is the blow up doll of food.
"My friend called me cheap. Im not cheap, Im broke. I just don't have money. That's like telling someone with cancer they're a hypochondriac."
So an ex for a gay guy is a flaming old flame?
"My old girlfriend wanted me to be a little more old fashioned, so I dumped her cuz she was black."
I have a Peter Pan Complex. I don't want to stay young I just think if they made a movie about me I would be played by a woman.
I just heard that urine and tears are pretty much the same thing. So if you're embarrassed about crying you can say your eyes are peeing.
I was relieved to know I wasn't gay after not enjoying gay porn. I was relieved to know I wasn't racist after not enjoying NASCAR.
No human can eat over 50 vicodins. Or is that eggs?

I saw a homeless guy drinking an energy drink last night. Why drink booze and forget your problems when you can really focus on them?
My girlfriend just changed all our light bulbs to 10 year energy saver bulbs. How long did you expect this to last? How bout candles?
"First Michael Jackson then Farrah faucet now Gadhafi!! Well, there goes all my bedroom posters!"
"At a show last night the black guys were mad because they were put in the back. But it's not racial, thats just where they seat late people."
I slipped in the shower while masturbating today. And my sex life passed before my eyes. I've wasted my life!!!
My girlfriend is weird about sports. She's in a rape fantasy football league.
I'm headlining tonight at the good old @hartfordfunnybone at 7. I might bomb but that will easily be the most exciting thing in this town.
You should never refer to traditional sex as 'mom and pop'. It raises questions.

My friend is a real attention whore. Thats kinda redundant. Don't all whores need attention?
I'm surprised the term 'short-comings' isn't used more in a sexual context.
"For the record, just because I have an erection doesn't mean I'm happy to see you."
If ur an over-eater and a great cook that's not good. Its like a meth addict who makes meth at home. Then ur the Breaking Bad of lasagna.
"In honor of Columbus day I'm gonna call an ethnic group the wrong ethnicity. Spanish people, get ready to be called 'jews'!!"
"My friend just asked me why there are no 'bisexual bars'. There are, they're just called bars."
"Whenever someone says ""I've just gotta be me"" it's after they've done something annoying. They never say that and donate money to a charity."
Having sex with a super hero sounds awesome but imagine how disappointed they would be.
"Having a tweet ""favorited"" is like when a girl sleeps with you but says 'don't tell anybody'. You appreciate it but it still hurts a little."

"I've gotta stop saying ""get it girl"" to myself."
A dildo is literally a gag gift.
"If you get a heart attack from eating too much Canadian Bacon, at the hospital they should treat you for free."
Wearing a condom reminds me of trying to use an Ipod with a glove on.
"My friend got in trouble for having sex with a16 year old. I mean, he is 16 too but it was still non-consensual."
You know that feeling when you're reading a book and you can't wait to start another one? Me neither.
"We shouldn't have 'dog years', we should have 'day job hours'. 7 minutes in the real world takes one hour at an office."

Im at @CarolinesonBway tonight at 8! Opening for the funny and well quaffed @rippedlikejesus. See you there!
My boss has a fireplace in his bathroom. That's too many burning sensations.
"Man, am I lazy! I was late for work this morning and I work from home."
"Saw an ad that said: ""Together we're gonna make herpes history!"" That can go two ways. Thats like an ad that says: ""HPV, it can't be beat!"""
"You do the meth. Wait, I mean math!!!!"
I wonder if camels are ever concerned that their toes look like a vagina.
It's nice that opportunity knocks. Or it would have walked in on me changing.
What's worse? Ethnic cleansing or sangria?
What do single women do when they need their dress zipped up?
"Is it weird to anyone else that cellphone stores still use land lines? Come on, Have some faith in your product!"
"That'd be cool if braille was inspirational. ""Look, being blind sucks but you can do this."""
Homophobia is interesting cuz it's the only hatred towards a group that's not racial. They don't care if you're black or white just not gay.
"Seems weird to get a happy ending after a massage. Why not a happy ending after a bad appointment. ""My license needs renewing, sweet!"""
Aren't you glad summer reading is over?
I donated a kidney bean.
I hate myself after I eat fast food and before too.

At a gay bar a guy asked if I was gay. I said 'if I was at a biker bar would you think I was a biker?' He said 'you don't look like a biker.
"I wonder if anyone was ever actually ""asking for it""?"
"Let's play the old game of ""Youtube comment or what a Klansman wrote on a brick he threw through a minorities window!?"
It sucks that heterosexual women's only option is men.
"My best talent is seeing a guy I know before they see me and hiding. My next best talent is, if they see me, pretending Im glad to see him."
Misogynists are always such tough guys. But hating women seems like the gayest thing you can be.
I just saw a small hipster girl apologize to a large black guy for not having much of an ass. He appreciated it.
Its weird that game shows have a 'consolation' prize. Whenever I have to console my girlfriend I never get her a dinette set.
"A girl told me she always knows whos gay cuz she can sense if a man doesnt want her. But shes unattractive, so she must think everyones gay."
Its crazy that years ago we actually had dog catchers. Did they get new jobs? I guess those guys just became border patrol officers.
"Jew is the only religion you can use as an adjective. ""Jewy"" You cant do that w other religions. ""Bob wont let his wife drive, kinda Muzzy."""
Celebrities make every product look better. Except for Scientology. That religion is so nuts that even celebs couldn't save it.
I was a mature kid. My first patch in cub scouts was a nicotine.
I can't remember 9/11 and the Alamo! I'm just gonna pick one!
There's so much porn online it seems statistically impossible that I haven't seen anyone I know yet.
"I'm sitting next to a stripper on a flight, she's telling me about her childhood. I cant believe she got on the plane with all this baggage."
"Don't you hate it when you're at Target and someone says 'hey, do you work here?' And you do."
If religious people say grace before eating why don't they say grace before sex? Shouldn't you be thankful for both?
How come any time they show a prisoner in his cell he's an amazing drawer?
"The Jewish channel is really trying to compete for ratings but ""Loan Shark Week"" is just not cutting it."

Have you ever been so poor and broke that you don't even feel white?
"I saw a homeless guy begging for change and getting nothing. He finally yelled out ""I give up!"" Yeah, we got that."
"I heard dolphins tend to rape other dolphins. They should call a pack of dolphins a ""fraternity."""
White people seemed to be scared of two things: looking racist and minorities.
I think the worst part of being a farmer is the fact that your daughter is automatically a whore.
I think I'm gonna treat myself today and wear clean underwear.
"""Ointment"" is a funny word."
"You ever meet someone and play the game ""gay or foreign?"""
Jews....
I was much smarter as a kid. If I knew then what I know now I would've have failed out of high school.
"I had to wear a fanny pack around new York today. I was surprised, for how small it is, it packs a lot of embarrassment."
Gay people are getting married in New York! Check out how New Yorkers feel about it in this new video!
I wanna see a documentary about a guy in a wheelchair who's not trying to overcome anything. Just a guy enjoying the downtime.
That'd be cool if there was a word as powerful as the 'N word' but had the complete opposite effect.
Woman always say 'my biological clock is ticking' when they want a baby. But why would it start ticking then? Clocks tick from the start.
At lunch with my boss I was talking about how all feminists are ugly. She said she was a feminist so I said 'can you pick up the check?'
Do we really need the 'male' in male pattern baldness? Seems unnecessary. We don't say female menstrual cycle.
"I met a woman online that has so much in common with me. We have the same taste in movies, the same birthday and the same parents."

A black NASCAR driver is the only one that can use a race-car(d).
The audiobook was better.
I'll know I've made it when I stop stealing change off my friends floor while they're in the bathroom.
Last night I saw two shadowy figures coming towards me. I was scared until I noticed it was two gays holding hands. They took everything.
It's not all black and white. Some are Asian.
"My Priest wants me to call him father. Yet, it really bothers him when I call him daddy."
The one positive thing about overweight American kids is if they keep gaining weight maybe the pedophiles will give up.
If someone refers to you as 'harmless' it's not a good thing. It just means you're not really in the way.
"Theres no way to prove youre not racist. We need a racist breathalyzer test. 'Youve got a rebel flag on your truck, please blow into this.'"
Gays are fighting for rights just like women did years ago. But I think women were always allowed to get married.
Having kids to me is basically just making new people for other people to have sex with.
It's considered gay to like anything feminine except the most feminine thing: females. Weird.
I'm very in touch with my feminine side. I'm not sensitive or emotional. I just want free dinners and a lotta compliments.
I saw a prostitute on 10th avenue last night with a dollar sign tattoo on her shoulder. How trashy! At least take the price tag off.
"My girlfriend says she dumped her ex because he took longer to get ready than her. Cut the guy some slack, he was in a wheelchair."
"There are no funeral photographers. ""Everybody get together. Look sad. Say 'mortality'""."
My pal loves steaks and strippers but he saw a film on how meat was made and now cant eat it. I may show em a film on how strippers are made
A girl told me shes never worried about me cuz I'm not masculine enough to rape anybody. So Should i toughen up?
"Every time a girl has said to me ""you know just what to say"" it's right after I've lied."
My penis is homophobic.

I feel sorry for the guy who actually invents a Penis Enlargement pill that works. No one will believe him. Unless he gets naked...
With the inflation over the years 'feeling like a million bucks' is not as good as it used to be.
People who were ever abused or molested shouldn't be allowed to write reviews on Yelp.
The KKK now has a podcast. So now a clansmen will hate minorities and the sound of his own voice.
It's ironic how many immigrants are watching these fireworks.
"Kids are like sponges, eventually they get really gross and you've gotta throw them out."
I often wonder what would happen if every man on the planet boycotted sex for 6 months. Then women would know what it was like.
It's fun when you approach an attractive person who's way out of your league then when they start talking you realize you're out of theirs.
I think I might be a necropheliac. I can't stop stealing things.
"My girlfriends dad made us break up cuz im not Jewish. Come on, I live in new York, I'm circumcised, I'm a comedian. Im like right there!"
They say that a lot of serial killers tortured animals when they were kids. Well I never tortured animals but I did stare at their anuses.
"Me and the girlfriend have been fighting a lot lately. Last night she threw a plate at me, I mean it was a paper plate but she crumpled it!"
I think I finally hit the nail on the head. Hipster girls dress like Murphy Brown when's she about to paint her apartment.
Gay marriage joke
It's weird that calling a woman a 'doll' is considered a positive thing.
My friend can't stop smoking. He wears 6 nicotine patches a day. I was taught that you only get a patch when you accomplish something.
Make strippers are the guy version of the WNBA. Both are unwatchable for the opposite sex.
Don't you hate it when you're at Walgreens and somebody says 'Hey do you work here?' and you do?
"My friend says if something can keep going without advertising then its really good. You know, like pedophilia, rape and Cheesecake Factory."
"We've got interracial porn, gay porn. I'm still waiting on Jew porn."

The leader of the kkk is called the grand wizard? What a bunch of nerds!
Women don't appreciate other womens bodies. I showed my girlfriend a pic of me ex in a bikini and she didn't care for it.
All guys are 'creeps'. The ones you refer to as creeps are just trying to cut to the chase.
I saw a bumper sticker that said 'racism is a disease.' Thats not good. We don't want those guys in the Make-a-wish program.
Thank you @stressfactorycc for a great weekend! Im glad i had fun cuz tomorrow I go back to work at a regular factory.

You know how some people have a beer belly? Well my friend has cocaine face.
I wonder if animals would mate more if they drank. Maybe that's what we should be doing with those prude pandas. Give them booze.
"I saw a lady pouring a sugar packet on a donut. She looked at me and said ""dont judge me."" Hate to break it to ya, I judged u at the donut."
Being Jewish and hair loss both come from the mothers side. I have both. I'm not sure which upsets me more.
My dandruff let's me know where I've been. It's like my own personal bread crumbs.
Whenever my girlfriend hands me her half of the rent I like to pretend she's paying me to date her.
You know what's cool about the gays? they can't reproduce but they still keep popping up. That's impressive.
I often wonder if I got a pho hawk how many friends I'd lose/gain.
"Someone at work told me 'in another life I was a comedian'. Thats interesting, because in another life I wouldn't go to your show."
"Someone at work told me 'in another life I was a comedian'. Thats interesting, because in another life I still wouldn't care."
Im a political comedian. But I only talk about the politics of the restaurant I work at. #Shelly gets the good section cuz she knows the gm.
My masseuse is very disrespectful to women. You might say he's a massage-gynist.
They say if you fail at something you should keep trying till you get it right.  That's works for everything except kids
If a man's in prison for a while he tends to go gay. Do you think if you put a gay man in a womans prison would he go for the ladies?
You ever see a girl who looks great from behind then when she turns around you realize it's your father? That ever happened to you?
You never meet a guy with an STD named Abraham.
If steroids are performance enhancing drugs we should give them to cops.
"Because of the weather I have this gross film on me. The film is ""Blue Velvet."""

"At the office, can we stop saying the phrase 'never a dull moment'? That's all it is. Constant brutally dull moments!"
Someone told me today that I was the funniest guy at the office. That doesn't help me. That's like saying you're the best actor in a porn.
"I wonder if blind people ever do something really inconsiderate and just say ""Well, I'll never see that person again."""
I wish these gays would stop hitting on me! Sorry ladies but I'm not a lesbian.
I'm pretty proud of myself. I recently burned down a building full of racist people. It was an old folks home.
"I saw gay marriage protesters saying ""Its Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve!"" But Adam and Eve weren't married anyway."
"I learned the hard way that no one finds it funny if you go up to the body at a funeral and say ""you're dead to me."""
God came on me in a dream last night.
"I saw a girl bum a tampon from another girl today. I was hoping the other girl would say 'sorry, I only 2 left...'"
If it rains at your wedding it's bad luck. If it rains at your funeral you're dead so what's the difference?
"Don't you hate it when your mom sends you pointless articles? I get it mom, grandmas dead."
I worked at TGIF's in college. There slogan is: Here its always friday. Not if you work there.
I buy Big Black Asses for the articles!
My friend is a beer reviewer. All day he sits in his apartment and drinks free beer and writes about it. I think he's becoming a workaholic.
Whatever happened to the St. Bernards w the mini booze barrel on their neck? That should come back. How fun would that be at a house party?
I just got yelled at for cursing in front of a baby. Who better to curse in front of than a baby?
"My boss just yelled at me that there's no twittering at the office! Well, it's a good thing I'm tweeting."
Enough with the state birds and James Dean. The next stamp design should be 'tramp'. A small butterfly or tribal symbol.
"My boss always says 'we are gonna clean this'. But its just me. I'm gonna start doing this. ""I cant believe we masturbated in the coat room"""
They say dogs start to pick up characteristics of their owners. Which explains why my girlfriends dog stopped having sex with me.

I once used a blow up doll while I laying on an air mattress. It was like I was sleeping with this woman on her fatter relative.
This guy here has a mouth like a sailor. He won't stop saying 'ahoy'.
They say great minds think alike. But what about a theater full of people at a Tyler Perry movie?
"As a southerner, when something goes wrong can we stop saying ""it went south""? When things go mediocre I don't say ""they went Midwest."""
"Apparently, at your day job it's not a compliment if you tell the girl at the front desk she's hot enough to be in office porn."
What's worse than second hand smoke is second hand perfume. I'd rather inhale a little nicotine than smell like my Aunt Pearl.
It's good to be back in NYC! I haven't been that happy to see a black guy since we were losing that pick up basketball game.
"After you've find out a guys name is Ralph, never say ""Oh yeah, you look like a Ralph..."""
"Seeing a BlockBuster is like seeing a Native American. I'm always like ""we haven't gotten rid of you yet?"""
"Last night someone told me to ""watch my language around the lady."" really? You are aware that women put penises in their mouths right?"
It's too bad that milkman isn't an available job anymore. They seemed to get laid a lot.
"I asked a coworker what was the name of the new black employee and he said 'I dont see color.' So I said ""its cool man, I'm black."""
"My friend says it's gay to use a lot of exclamation points. But what about all the homophobes? ""Get outta here you queer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'"""
"The new Nicholas Cage trailer looks good. Also, I hear he's living in it with his daughter."
"Now in NYC, by law, once you get into a cab they have to take you wherever you want. So now I get in and say ""take me to when I was happy."""
I saw a white guy with blonde dreadlocks and he was balding really badly. It was like his body was making good decisions for him.
When I was a kid I used to cut girls ponytails off. I had it backwards. I should have waited and done that to adult men.
My barber sells drugs to stay in business. Mostly weed and Propecia.
Cleavage is the female version of personality.

Updated insult: You've got a face for pod-casting.
The blockbuster in my neighborhood has broken down and started selling porn. It's like a failing comedy club that turns into a strip club.
Pedophilia? Thats kids stuff.
What is the sexual harassment policy at the youporn offices?
"You ever looking through your closet, can't find anything to wear and realize you hate your father?"
One of the worst things about being an adult male is the option of sitting in someones lap is completely over.
Cheese seems so much unhealthier when it's heated up. So does cocaine.
It took me so long to register for a passport! I wonder if it takes that long to register as a sex offender.
Had fun getting heckled by a drunk Asian girl before the @nerdist went up and really tsunamied her last night at UCB.
We made the the old top 8.
"There are now vegan strip clubs. Who came up with that? ""I wanna combine my two favorite things topless woman and steamed kale!"""
You never hear it the other way: I'm in love with you but I don't love you.
I learned the hard way that telling a girl she looks like a female brad Pitt is not a compliment.
Someone told me recently that everyone 'is a little gay.' That's not true. Some people are really gay.
The world is your oyster. The world makes you horny and gives you food poisoning.
Should we really be rewarding racists by letting them out of jury duty?
"I can't tell if men are attractive so I'm always asking girls. Then they ask me if I'm gay. If I was gay, I'd know if they were attractive."
I can't tell you how glad I am every time I realize I don't have to go to school.
What's the etiquette on hitting a drag queen?
It's gotta really bother the grand wizard that he can't put that on his resume.

This white guy claims 'he doesn't see color'. Well then why aren't you tackling black guys when they say the n-word.
Tonight I think I'm gonna drink a bunch of mini liquor bottles and drive go carts! Kind of a cuter drunk driving.
When my Internet isn't working I flip out. Even more than I do if my hot water goes out.  Because you can't masturbate to hot water.
"The password to the computers at my office is ""Nuthouse"". Get it? Because we're all crazy here."
See you jews tonight at the Williamsburg Hall of Music opening for the old @reggiewatts!! 9pm!
"Before cars it mustve been hard to ride a horse drunk. It's hard to drive a car when ur sloppy, imagine driving something with a personality"
We should all be thankful we're not pedophiles. We should be even more thankful that children aren't horny.
"If it bothers you that you can't tell someone's ethnicity, it's probably better that you didn't know it."
"I just realized I haven't broken and started crying in a while. Oh wait, here it comes!"
Never get a thermometer from a thrift store.
"Calling someone crazy is ok as long as it's not specific. ""Do you know jeff, he's crazy!"" ""Do you know jeff, he's manic depressive!"""
One nice thing about racism is anyone can do it. Any race is allowed to do it. Racism isn't prejudice.
I don't get why it's inappropriate to call girls 'dickless'.
They say it's healthy to fantasize in bed. So when I'm having sex with my girlfriend I pretend I have a bigger penis.
I love a girl who doesn't know how hot she is. I hate a girl who doesn't know how ugly she is.
I had a dream last night that my uncle told me I was gay. Which was a relief because usually we're just having sex.
My girlfriend is sad and threatening to dump me because she says I'm not around enough. But if we breakup I'll never be around.
A girl at my office has gotten 3 guys fired for sexual harassment. After a while I bet she starts bragging about that.
I've gotta song stuck in my shoulder.
They should make gift cards for hospital visits. I don't need anything from Best Buy. But I could definitely use a check up.

"You never hear a man say: ""Ouch, you're hurting me!"""
What's more self indulgent? Masturbating to a video of you having sex or laughing at your own youtube clips? I've done both today.
My father is my strength. I don't know my own strength.
You ever try to do something nice and it ends up ruining things for you? That's the last time I wear a condom.
It's gonna be extra sad when I drink alone today.
I wouldn't eat vegetables if it weren't for subway.
Can you still be a wine connoisseur if you call it booze?
"I have to remember when a girl I'm with takes her shirt off not to yell ""this is the best day of my life!!!"""
"Whenever I find out a black baseball player is actually Dominican, I realize I've been yelling the wrong slur at the screen."
It's so frustrating when a porn won't load. It must be how a girl feels when a guy can't get it up. Now I get it ladies...
My friend always makes fun of me for going to thrift shops. He says its gross to have things another person owned. But his kids are adopted.
"To a pedophile, is a 13 year-old a cougar?"
"Woooeee! Opening for @amyschumer  tonight and all weekend at @PBImprov!! Thursday, Friday and Saturday! 5 Shows! See you jews there!"
Not being racist is like recycling. Its better for the world but it takes a little more effort.
I'm really into white women.
It's too bad you can't adopt grandchildren. Then my parents would be happy.
I like this holiday because it let's you know who all the crazy people are.

The only thing worse than getting caught pooing at work is getting caught stealing toilet paper at work.
Im trying to be a little more politically correct.  From now on I won't call them mini-fridges. I'll call them little fridges?
I saw a guy reading a book called Kama Sutra 2 on the train today. Somebody should tell that guy that sequels are never as good.
"Don't you hate when people take a while to text you back? Come on, it's been hours Natalie Portman."
Can you be a perfectionist if you're fat aunt Rita?
I'm pretty sure the first guy to have sex with an animal was also the first guy to put raisins in coleslaw. Both are inhumane.
"A dumb Miss America contestant: ""If I could wish for anything it would be world peace and quiet."""
You got me an itunes gift card as a present? You don't know me at all. Don't you know I steal music!?
I have a fear of commitment so romantic comedies are my horror films.
I'm so manly I stand up to poo.
When you're arguing with a girl and she starts crying it's the same feeling as when you're trying to kill a roach and it starts flying.
"Is debtors prison real? And if so, do you get raped there?"
"Racist pedophile: (sitting in van looking at school yard through binoculars) ""Man this is the last time I scout for kids in the south Bronx"""
"When you think about it, men are really the ones that need training bras."
Isn't it weird that you can refer to a holocaust victim as a camper?
"Man, I really need to update the numbers in my rolodex."
"Scientists just discovered that hair loss does not come from the mother's side. Unfortunately, Judaism still does."
Crate and barrel sounds like a magazine for homeless people.
"At the airport a gay guy laughed at me for reading a conic book but he was reading a bridal magazine. Come on,  These are both fantasy."
"In honor of presidents day, I think Im gonna start smoking."

My friend just got a job at facebook. I wonder what he looks on his computer at work to slack off. Myspace?
"My boss just said to me: ""where'd you learn to mop?"" I don't know. Fantasia? Who learns mopping?"
Do you think Shakespeare would have been as effective with typos?
"After buying flowers last night some guy yelled ""look at the queer with the lilacs!""  Projecting?"
"Have you been so broke you've said to yourself ""there's gotta be money on the ground somewhere."""
My boss said he wants the lobby as spotless as an army mess hall. I don't know how to get something so clean that it doesn't allow gays.
"What, do you think I was born again virgin yesterday?"
The only thing couch surfing and real surfing have in common is the whole time you're just trying to get back on your feet.
Homophobophobia: a fear of looking like you fear gay people.
"I know it's PC to say ""little people."" So why are all these actors thanking midgets? ""I wanna thank all the little people."""
Hating a whole minority group is just ignorant. So does that mean racism is bliss?
"I'd imagine if you were really allergic to cats, you might die if you were hanging around a tiger."
"I bet pedophiles get bummed out when they hear the phrase ""look, we're all adults here."""

I had to follow a tap dancer last night. Tap dancing is like wine to me. I can't tell if it's good or not.

They say suicide is the most selfish thing but what about on Halloween when a lady left out a bowl of candy and one kid would take it all?
Do you think the guy who invented the condom kinda regrets it?
Never trust a gynecologist with a mustache.
Thanks man! RT- @marknorm @ComedyWorks @amyschumer Show last night was fucking awesome. Last 3 shows tonight! Come out!
I don't trust girls who can't dance.
My parents don't believe in God but they believe in me. What does that say about religion?
First night of featuring @ComedyWorks in Dever for the ole @amyschumer! This is gonna be a doozy of a weekend! Not many jews here!

Does it ever feel like you're getting paid at your job just to be sad? Not to do work but just to be unhappy. I should be making more money.
My friend likes getting sick cuz he loves the taste of his medicine. He has glaucoma.
Isn't it crazy that everybody gets horny?? Everybody! Even that old Chinese lady who picks up cans! Crazy.
I took Tylenol PMs Last night and had some crazy dreams. Thank god MLK didn't take any before his dream or dinosaurs may have rights.
Do you think if dogs drank alcohol we'd have more puppies around?
I just watched a baby grab like four women's jugs and no one cared! If this baby was in a strip club it woulda been kicked out immediately.
Marriage is scary. Even the dog whisperer got a divorce! He can communicate with dogs yet he cant keep it together with his HUMAN wife.
